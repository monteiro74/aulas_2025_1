AB  - Under the background of the national policy of promoting agriculture
      through science and technology, agricultural high-tech are emerging
      continuously. How to evaluate these technologies objectively and
      efficiently to help enterprises make decisions is of great significance to
      promote the industrialization of technologies. To solve problems in
      traditional evaluation process,such as the lag of evaluation method, the
      subjective influence of experts, time consuming, labor consuming and low
      efficiency, an intelligent comprehensive evaluation method based on
      machine learning was proposed. To establish a hierarchical evaluation
      index system using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the index system is
      firstly quantified, and then 25 agricultural high-tech in different fields
      are selected and scored by experts; To build BP Neural Network model, the
      data obtained from experts' experience are selected as samples to train
      the model, achieve the intelligent comprehensive evaluation and
      calculation of agricultural high-tech. The experiment proves that compared
      with the Support Vector Machine(SVM) model, the absolute error between the
      output value and the real value obtained by BP Neural Network(BP-NN) model
      is within the range of (-0.06 0.08), the average relative error is
      0.0265%. It can be seen that BP Neural Network applied to the
      comprehensive evaluation of agricultural high-tech is with high accuracy
      and simple usage, and can meet the requirements of agricultural high-tech
      comprehensive evaluation.

AB  - In 2018, agriculture remains an important sector of Malaysia's economy,
      contributing around 7.54% to national GDP and 11.09% to the total
      employment. However, in agriculture, price volatility is often
      unpredictable due to the reliability of agricultural production on natural
      phenomena. Instability of prices endanger the development of Malaysia's
      economy and the food accessibility by consumers, which may lead to food
      insecurity, hunger and malnutrition. Thus, the need of an accurate
      forecasting model for agricultural commodity price is acute, especially
      for government and farmers to propose new policies and better plantation
      plan to deal with potential risks in the markets. In the context of
      forecasting, optimal lag selection is important to improve the forecast
      performance in terms of time and accuracy. The main goal of this research
      is to study and design novel machine learning strategies with optimal lag
      time selection function to forecast agricultural commodity price more
      accurately in order to improve plantation plan in Malaysia.

AB  - The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations predicts
      that in order to meet the needs of the expected 3 billion population
      growth by 2050, food production has to increase by 60%. Therefore,
      monitoring and mapping crops accurately is essential for estimating food
      production during each crop growing season across the globe.
      Traditionally, multispectral remote sensing imagery has been widely used
      for mapping crops worldwide. However, single date imagery does not capture
      temporal characteristics (phenology) of growing crops, leading to
      imprecise crop maps and food estimates. On the other hand, purely temporal
      classification approaches also produce inaccurate crop maps as they do not
      account for spatial autocorrelations. In this paper, we present a
      multimodal deep learning solution that jointly exploits spatial-spectral
      and phenological properties to identify major crop types. Using a two
      stream architecture, spatial characteristics are captured via a spatial
      stream consisting of very high resolution images (single date, 1m,
      3-spectral bands, USDA NAIP) with a CNN and the phenological
      characteristics via a temporal stream images (biweekly, 250m, MODIS NDVI)
      with an LSTM. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal
      solution reduces prediction error by 60%.

      are playing an increasingly key role in the agriculture sector in order to
      tackle the increasing challenges due to the climate changes which are
      causing serious damage production. The analysis of environmental, climatic

      disease world over, including Sardinia. Unexpected epidemics can result in
      significant economic and yield losses. In this paper, we describe the test
      conducted using the DSS LANDS in order to predict potato late blight
      disease in Sardinia. The object of the study was to investigate if
      regional weather variables could be used to predict potato late blight
      risk in southern Sardinia using a Machine Learning approach. The disease
      severity is predicted using Feed-forward Neural Network and Support Vector
      Machine Classification based on meteorological parameters provided by
      ARPAS weather stations. The prediction accuracy for ANN was 96% and for
      SVM Classification was 98%.

AB  - Economy of an India is majorly depending on growth of agricultural yields,
      and its allied agro industry products. Prediction of agricultural yield
      growth is a most difficult for the agriculture departments across iglobe.
      1The agricultural yields growth is depending on several factors. In this
      paper historical data is analyzed and a predictive model was designed.
      1Several Regression models such as linear model, multiple linear model and
      nonlinear models were tested for an effective prediction, or for
      forecasting the agricultural yield for a variety of crops. Along with this
      the crop trade for local farmers is a very complicated and tedious task
      and can get easily mislead by the system we are proposing helps them to
      analyze the crop availability and also according to market prices can be
      able to predict various characteristics of the trade. The proposed method
      is capable of producing the visual representation after data analysis and
      provides the prediction results in a visual format. And also the
      unstructured data analysis is implemented in the system. In the proposed
      method, the pre-processed input data will be sent to perform a descriptive
      analysis and a predictive analysis. In the descriptive analysis, the data
      is analyzed and the summary of the analysis is given as the output.In
      Predictive analysis, there are steps to be considered for the analysis. At

AB  - Agricultural enterprises play a significant role in China&#x2019;s economic development. However, compared with other enterprises, agricultural enterprises are facing serious financial problems. Financing difficulty is essentially a question of financing efficiency. Based on the DEA method, this paper evaluates the financing efficiency of 39 agricultural listed companies in China from 2013 to 2017. The results suggest that the financing efficiency is generally low, and the Total Factor Productivity of agricultural enterprises&#x2019; financing has a tendency to decrease first and then increase. The influencing factors of financing efficiency are analyzed using the Tobit regression model and the random forest regression model. And we find the following: (1) The random forest regression model significantly outperformed the Tobit regression model, with determination coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) greater than 0.9 in full sample sets. (2) Total liability, financial expenses, return on total assets, and inventory turnover rate are important factors affecting financing efficiency of agricultural listed companies. (3) Return on total assets and inventory turnover rate promote the financing efficiency, while total liability and financial expenses reduce financing efficiency. Finally, the paper makes some suggestions for the financing of agricultural enterprises.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Classification for Crop-Type Mapping Using the Fusion of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery in a Semiarid Area
SP  - 8810279
VL  - 2021
AB  - The monitoring of cultivated crops and the types of different land covers is a relevant environmental and economic issue for agricultural lands management and crop yield prediction. In this context, this paper aims to use and evaluate the contribution of multisensors classification based on machine learning classifiers to crop-type identification in a semiarid area of Morocco. It is a very heterogeneous zone characterized by mixed crops (tree crops with annual crops, same crop with different phenological states during the same agricultural season, crop rotation, etc.). Therefore, such heterogeneity made the crop-type discrimination more complicated. To overcome these challenges, the present work is the first study in this area which used the fusion of high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images for land use and land cover mapping. Three machine learning classifier algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML), were applied to identify and map crop types in irrigated perimeter. In situ observations of the year 2018, for the R3 perimeter of Haouz plain in central Morocco, were used with satellite data of the same year to perform this work. The results showed that combined images acquired in C-band and the optical range improved clearly the crop-type classification performance (overall accuracy&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;89&#x0025;; Kappa&#x2009;&#x3d;&#x2009;0.85) compared to the classification results of optical or SAR data alone.

AB  - E-agriculture is the integration of technology and digital mechanisms into agricultural processes for more efficient output. This study provided a machine learning&#x2013;aided mobile system for farmland optimization, using various inputs such as location, crop type, soil type, soil pH, and spacing. Random forest algorithm and BigML were employed to analyze and classify datasets containing crop features that generated subclasses based on random crop feature parameters. The subclasses were further grouped into three main classes to match the crops using data from the companion crops. The study concluded that the approach aided decision making and also assisted in the design of a mobile application using Appery.io. This Appery.io then took in some user input parameters, thereby offering various optimization sets. It was also deduced that the system led to users&#x2019; optimization of information when implemented on their farmlands.

TI  - Big Data and Machine Learning With Hyperspectral Information in
      Agriculture
T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - Hyperspectral and multispectral information processing systems and technologies have demonstrated its usefulness for the improvement of agricultural productivity and practices by providing useful information to farmers and crop managers on the factors affecting crop status and growth. These technologies are widely used in a range of agriculture applications such as crop management, crop yield forecasting, crop disease detection, and the monitoring of agriculture land usage, water, and soil conditions. Hyperspectral information sensing can acquire several hundred spectral bands that cover the electromagnetic spectrum of an observational scene in a single acquisition. The resulting hyperspectral data cube contains a large volume of spatial and spectral information. The hyperspectral sequence of images or video further increases the data generation velocity and volume which lead to the Big data challenges particularly in agricultural remote sensing applications. This paper is structured to first give a comprehensive review of representative studies to provide insights into significant research efforts in agriculture using Big data, machine learning and deep learning with the focus on frameworks or architectures, information processing and analytics with hyperspectral and multispectral data. The potential for utilizing Big data, machine learning and deep learning for hyperspectral and multispectral data in agriculture is very promising. The paper then further explores the potential of using ensemble machine learning and scalable parallel discriminant analysis which takes into consideration the spatial and spectral components for Big data in agriculture. To the best of our knowledge, no similar review study on agriculture with Big data, machine learning and deep learning for hyperspectral and multispectral information processing has been reported. Furthermore, the potential of ensemble machine learning and scalable parallel discriminant analysis has not been explored in agriculture information processing. Experiments and data analytics have been performed on hyperspectral data from agriculture for validation. The results have shown the good performance of our approach.

      Considerations for Digital Agriculture at Scale
T2  - IEEE Open Journal of the Computer Society
AB  - Digital agriculture, with the incorporation of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based technologies, presents the ability to control a system at multiple levels (individual, local, regional, and global) and generates tools that allow for improved decision making and higher productivity. Recent advances in IoT hardware, e.g., networks of heterogeneous embedded devices, and software, e.g., lightweight computer vision algorithms and cloud optimization solutions, make it possible to efficiently process data from diverse sources in a connected (smart) farm. By interconnecting these IoT devices, often across large geographical distances, it is possible to collect data at different time scales, including in near real-time (i.e., with delays of only a few tens of seconds). This data can then be used for actionable insights, e.g., precise applications of soil supplements and reduced environmental footprint. Through LATTICE, we present an integrated vision for IoT solutions, data processing, and actionable analytics for digital agriculture. We couple this with discussion of economics and policy considerations that will underlie adoption of such IoT and ML technologies. Our paper starts off with the types of datasets in typical field operations, followed by the lifecycle for the data and storage, cloud and edge analytics, and fast information-retrieval solutions. We discuss what algorithms are proving to be most impactful in this space, e.g., approximate data analytics and on-device/in-network processing. We conclude by discussing analytics for alternative agriculture for generation of biofuels and policy challenges in the implementation of digital agriculture in the wild.

AB  - Machine learning is one of the recent trends. Currently it is being used in variety of interdisciplinary domains. The major contribution of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of India belongs to agriculture production directly or indirectly. Most of the population in India is still dependent on farming or livestock for their regular income. Due to sufficient availability of solar energy, gifted by nature, in India we found the variety of crops. Major farmers hold fragmented land and adapt rain-feed cropping with traditional and repeated crop pattern. For increasing yield farmers add the fertilizers in extra quantity, which leads to soil degradation. Rather than repeated crop farmer should go for suitable crops, according available environmental condition. Here we have discussed machine learning approaches to develop Agriculture Advisory System. Comparative analysis of different supervised techniques with hybrid approach is done with the help of their performances.

      Machine Learning techniques
T2  - 2021 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems
      Engineering (SCSE)
AB  - Climate variability in recent years has critically affected the usual aspects of human lives, where the agriculture sector can be considered as one of the most vulnerable. Sri Lanka is also facing these climate changes over the past few decades. It has resulted in rainfall pattern changes where the expected rain may not occur during the expected time and amount. The mismatch between the rainfall pattern and traditional seasonal cultivation schedule has critically affected the agricultural sustainability. Even with the current technological advancements, weather prediction is one of the most technically and scientifically challenging tasks. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based approach for predicting rainfall for precision agriculture in Sri Lanka and it can be recognized as the first attempt to validate machine learning models to predict the weather in Sri Lankan context for precision agriculture. By analyzing the nature of the weather in Sri Lanka, the relationship of weather attributes with agriculture, availability, and accessibility, seven attributes are selected including rain gauge, relative humidity, average temperature, wind speed, wind direction where solar radiation and ozone concentration are uniquely selected for Sri Lankan context. For the prediction model, cross-validated data are trained and tested with four machine learning algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Currently, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors models have achieved accuracies of 88.57%, 88.66%. Random Forest has been recognized as the best-fitted model with 89.16% accuracy. The results depict a significant accuracy in this novel approach for Sri Lankan weather prediction.

TI  - Machine learning model accurately predict maize grain yields in
      conservation agriculture systems in Southern Africa
T2  - 2021 9th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics
      (Agro-Geoinformatics)      
AB  - Adoption of CA in smallholder farmers in Africa is (s)low partly due to poor spatial targeting. Mapping the crop yield from different CA systems across space and time can reveal their spatial recommendation domains. Integration of machine learning (ML) and free remotely sensed big data have opened huge opportunities for data-driven insights into complex problems in agriculture. The objective of this study was to estimate the spatial-temporal variations of maize grain yields from 13-year multi-location on-farm trials implemented across four countries in southern Africa. The agronomic data from the long-term CA trials is used together with gridded biophysical and socio-economic variables. A spatially explicit random forest (RF) algorithm was developed. Spatial variation of yield advantage or loss from CA practices was compared with conventional tillage practices (CP) during seasons with above and below-normal precipitation. The out-of-bag accuracy of the RF model was R 2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 1.2 t ha -1 . The variable importance analysis showed that the altitude, precipitation, temperature, and soil physical and nutrients conditions variables explained most of the variation in maize grain yield. Maps were generated to identify the locations where CA had a yield advantage over CP during seasons with below and above-average precipitation. The CA showed yield gains of up-to 1 t ha -1 during the season with drought compared to CP. In contrast, the CA returned yield losses of similar magnitude during the season with above-normal precipitation, except in Mozambique. The maps on yield advantage will support the spatial targeting of CA to suitable biophysical and socioeconomic contexts. Results demonstrates that multi-source remotely sensed data, coupled with advanced and efficient machine learning algorithms can provides accurate, cost-effective, and timely platform for predicting the optimal locations for the upscaling sustainable agricultural technologies.

TI  - Identification of Tobacco Crop Based on Machine Learning for a Precision
      Agricultural Sprayer
T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - Agrochemicals, which are very efficacious in protecting crops, also cause environmental pollution and pose serious threats to farmers' health upon exposure. In order to cut down the environmental and human health risks associated with agrochemical application, there is a need to develop intelligent application equipment that could detect and recognize crops/weeds, and spray precise doses of agrochemical at the right place and right time. This paper presents a machine-learning based crop/weed detection system for a tractor-mounted boom sprayer that could perform site-specific spraying on tobacco crop in fields. An SVM classifier with a carefully chosen feature combination (texture, shape, and color) for tobacco plant has been proposed and 96% classification accuracy has been achieved. The algorithm has been trained and tested on a real dataset collected in local fields with diverse changes in scale, orientation, background clutter, outdoor lighting conditions, and variation between tobacco and weeds. Performance comparison of the proposed algorithm has been made with a deep learning based classifier (customized for real-time inference). Both algorithms have been deployed on a tractor-mounted boom sprayer in tobacco fields and it has been concluded that the SVM classifier performs well in terms of accuracy (96%) and real-time inference (6 FPS) on an embedded device (Raspberry Pi 4). In comparison, the customized deep learning-based classifier has an accuracy of 100% but performs much slower (0.22 FPS) on the Raspberry Pi 4.

TI  - A Multi-Modal Approach for Crop Health Mapping Using Low Altitude Remote
      Sensing, Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - The agriculture sector holds paramount importance in Pakistan due to the intrinsic agrarian nature of the economy. Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data. The proposed research is basically an indigenous, technology based agriculture solution capable of providing important insights into the crop health by extracting complementary features from multi-modal data set, and minimizing the crop ground survey effort, particularly useful when the agriculture land is large in size.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review of Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning
      Approaches With Special Emphasis on Palm Oil Yield Prediction
T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - An early and reliable estimation of crop yield is essential in quantitative and financial evaluation at the field level for determining strategic plans in agricultural commodities for import-export policies and doubling farmer's incomes. Crop yield predictions are carried out to estimate higher crop yield through the use of machine learning algorithms which are one of the challenging issues in the agricultural sector. Due to this developing significance of crop yield prediction, this article provides an exhaustive review on the use of machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield with special emphasis on palm oil yield prediction. Initially, the current status of palm oil yield around the world is presented, along with a brief discussion on the overview of widely used features and prediction algorithms. Then, the critical evaluation of the state-of-the-art machine learning-based crop yield prediction, machine learning application in the palm oil industry and comparative analysis of related studies are presented. Consequently, a detailed study of the advantages and difficulties related to machine learning-based crop yield prediction and proper identification of current and future challenges to the agricultural industry is presented. The potential solutions are additionally prescribed in order to alleviate existing problems in crop yield prediction. Since one of the major objectives of this study is to explore the future perspectives of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction, the areas including application of remote sensing, plant's growth and disease recognition, mapping and tree counting, optimum features and algorithms have been broadly discussed. Finally, a prospective architecture of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction has been proposed based on the critical evaluation of existing related studies. This technology will fulfill its promise by performing new research challenges in the analysis of crop yield prediction and the development of an extremely effective model for the prediction of palm oil yields with the most minimal computational difficulty.

TI  - An Object-Based Approach for Mapping Crop Coverage Using Multiscale
      Weighted and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote
      Sensing
AB  - Accurate mapping of crop distribution on Earth's surface aids in predicting grain production. Pattern classification along with remote sensing imagery can facilitate traditional manual field measurement techniques using machine learning. With the rapid increase in satellite sensor resolution, the object-based classification paradigm has increasingly been applied. However, scale parameter selection is always a difficult part of the object-based classification. Based on ensemble learning, this study proposes a classification method using the multiscale object-based weighted method which includes manual digitizing of crop distribution in the southern region of Jishan County, Shanxi Province, China, applying Gaofen-2 (GF-2) images. This method initially uses estimations of the scale parameter (ESP) tool to select “good” scales, defined here as “preferred” scales, after which feature subsets are screened by each preferred scale as the input of multiple classifiers and classifies. Finally, all classification results are then fused. Our research results indicate that: 1) Feature importance values are sorted differently at different preferred scales; 2) accuracy differences become clear when different preferred scales are combined with different classifiers, and determining the “best” single appropriate scale is generally difficult; 3) accuracy of the multiscale weighted classification method is higher compared to the single preferred scale approach. Furthermore, ensemble learning can be achieved using this method on multiple scales and on multiple classifiers. With this method, procedures that necessitate the selection of segmentation scales and the selection and optimization of classifiers can be skipped altogether.

AB  - The upcoming agricultural revolution, known as Agriculture 4.0, integrates
      cutting-edge Information and Communication Technologies in existing
      operations. Various cyber threats related to the aforementioned
      integration have attracted increasing interest from security researchers.
      Network traffic analysis and classification based on Machine Learning (ML)
      methodologies can play a vital role in tackling such threats. Towards this
      direction, this research work presents and evaluates different ML
      classifiers for network traffic classification, i.e., K-Nearest Neighbors
      (KNN), Support Vector Classification (SVC), Decision Tree (DT), Random
      Forest (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), as well as a hard
      voting and a soft voting ensemble model of these classifiers. In the
      context of this research work, three variations of the NSL-KDD dataset
      were utilized, i.e., initial dataset, undersampled dataset and oversampled
      dataset. The performance of the individual ML algorithms was evaluated in
      all three dataset variations and was compared to the performance of the
      voting ensemble methods. In most cases, both the hard and the soft voting
      models were found to perform better in terms of accuracy compared to the
      individual models.

DA  - 2021
AB  - In this paper, we apply the multi-class supervised machine learning
      techniques for classifying the agriculture farm machinery. The
      classification of farm machinery is important when performing the
      automatic authentication of field activity in a remote setup. In the
      absence of a sound machine recognition system, there is every possibility
      of a fraudulent activity taking place. To address this need, we classify
      the machinery using five machine learning techniques—K-Nearest Neighbor
      (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest
      (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB). For training of the model, we use the
      vibration and tilt of machinery. The vibration and tilt of machinery are
      recorded using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, respectively. The
      machinery included the leveler, rotavator and cultivator. The preliminary
      analysis on the collected data revealed that the farm machinery (when in
      operation) showed big variations in vibration and tilt, but observed
      similar means. Additionally, the accuracies of vibration-based and
      tilt-based classifications of farm machinery show good accuracy when used
      alone (with vibration showing slightly better numbers than the tilt).
      However, the accuracies improve further when both (the tilt and vibration)
      are used together. Furthermore, all five machine learning algorithms used
      for classification have an accuracy of more than 82%, but random forest
      was the best performing. The gradient boosting and random forest show
      slight over-fitting (about 9%), but both algorithms produce high testing
      accuracy. In terms of execution time, the decision tree takes the least
      time to train, while the gradient boosting takes the most time.

AB  - The data generated in modern agricultural operations are provided by
      diverse elements, which allow a better understanding of the dynamic
      conditions of the crop, soil and climate, which indicates that these
      processes will be increasingly data-driven. Big Data and Machine Learning
      (ML) have emerged as high-performance computing technologies to create new
      opportunities to unravel, quantify and understand agricultural processes
      through data. However, there are many challenges to achieve the
      integration of these technologies. It implies making some adaptations to
      ML for using it with Big Data. These adaptations must consider the
      increasing volume of data, its variety and the transmission speed issues.
      This paper provides information on the use of Big Data and ML for
      agriculture, identifying challenges, adaptations and the design of
      architectures for these systems. We conducted a Systematic Literature
      Review (SLR), which allowed us to analyze 34 real cases applied in
      agriculture. This review may be of interest to computer or data scientists
      and electronic or software engineers. The results show that manipulating
      large volumes of data is no longer a challenge due to Cloud technologies.
      There are still challenges regarding (1) processing speed due to little
      control of the data in its different stages, raw, semi-processed and
      processed data (value data); (2) information visualization systems, which
      support technical data little understood by farmers.

AB  - High frequency and spatially explicit irrigated land maps are important
      for understanding the patterns and impacts of consumptive water use by
      agriculture. We built annual, 30 m resolution irrigation maps using Google
      Earth Engine for the years 1986–2018 for 11 western states within the
      conterminous U.S. Our map classifies lands into four classes: irrigated
      agriculture, dryland agriculture, uncultivated land, and wetlands. We
      built an extensive geospatial database of land cover from each class,
      including over 50,000 human-verified irrigated fields, 38,000 dryland
      fields, and over 500,000 km 2 of uncultivated lands. We used 60,000 point
      samples from 28 years to extract Landsat satellite imagery, as well as
      climate, meteorology, and terrain data to train a Random Forest
      classifier. Using a spatially independent validation dataset of 40,000
      points, we found our classifier has an overall binary classification
      (irrigated vs. unirrigated) accuracy of 97.8%, and a four-class overall
      accuracy of 90.8%. We compared our results to Census of Agriculture
      irrigation estimates over the seven years of available data and found good
      overall agreement between the 2832 county-level estimates (r 2 = 0.90),
      and high agreement when estimates are aggregated to the state level (r 2 =
      0.94). We analyzed trends over the 33-year study period, finding an
      increase of 15% (15,000 km 2 ) in irrigated area in our study region. We
      found notable decreases in irrigated area in developing urban areas and in
      the southern Central Valley of California and increases in the plains of
      eastern Colorado, the Columbia River Basin, the Snake River Plain, and
      northern California.

AB  - This study aimed to understand the perception of drought among farmers, in
      order to support decision-making in the water allocation process. This
      study was carried out in the Tabuleiro de Russas irrigated perimeter, in
      northeast Brazil, over the drought period of 2012–2018. Two analyses were
      conducted: (i) drought characterization, using the Standardized
      Precipitation Index (SPI) based on drought duration and frequency
      criteria; and (ii) analysis of farmers’ perceptions of drought via
      selection of explanatory variables using the Random Forest (RF) and the
      Decision Tree (DT) methods. The 2012–2018 drought period was defined as a
      meteorological phenomenon by local farmers; however, an SPI evaluation
      indicated that the drought was of a hydrological nature. According to the
      RF analysis, four of the nine study variables were more statistically
      important than the others in influencing farmers’ perception of drought:
      number of cultivated land plots, farmer’s age, years of experience in the
      agriculture sector, and education level. These results were confirmed
      using DT analysis. Understanding the relationship between these variables
      and farmers’ perception of drought could aid in the development of an
      adaptation strategy to water deficit scenarios. Farmers’ perception can be
      beneficial in reducing conflicts, adopting proactive management practices,
      and developing a holistic and efficient early warning drought system.

AB  - Carrot yield maps are an essential tool in supporting decision makers in
      improving their agricultural practices, but they are unconventional and
      not easy to obtain. The objective was to develop a method to generate a
      carrot yield map applying a random forest (RF) regression algorithm on a
      database composed of satellite spectral data and carrot ground-truth yield
      sampling. Georeferenced carrot yield sampling was carried out and
      satellite imagery was obtained during crop development. The entire dataset
      was split into training and test sets. The Gini index was used to find the
      five most important predictor variables of the model. Statistical
      parameters used to evaluate model performance were the root mean squared
      error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute error
      (MAE). The five most important predictor variables were the near-infrared
      spectral band at 92 and 79 days after sowing (DAS), green spectral band at
      50 DAS and blue spectral band at 92 and 81 DAS. The RF algorithm applied
      to the entire dataset presented R2, RMSE and MAE values of 0.82, 2.64 Mg
      ha−1 and 1.74 Mg ha−1, respectively. The method based on RF regression
      applied to a database composed of spectral bands proved to be accurate and
      suitable to predict carrot yield.

AB  - Precision agriculture is considered to be a fundamental approach in
      pursuing a low-input, high-efficiency, and sustainable kind of agriculture
      when performing site-specific management practices. To achieve this
      objective, a reliable and updated description of the local status of crops
      is required. Remote sensing, and in particular satellite-based imagery,
      proved to be a valuable tool in crop mapping, monitoring, and diseases
      assessment. However, freely available satellite imagery with low or
      moderate resolutions showed some limits in specific agricultural
      applications, e.g., where crops are grown by rows. Indeed, in this
      framework, the satellite’s output could be biased by intra-row covering,
      giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper presents a
      novel satellite imagery refinement framework, based on a deep learning
      technique which exploits information properly derived from high resolution
      images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multispectral
      sensors. To train the convolutional neural network, only a single
      UAV-driven dataset is required, making the proposed approach simple and
      cost-effective. A vineyard in Serralunga d’Alba (Northern Italy) was
      chosen as a case study for validation purposes. Refined satellite-driven
      normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, acquired in four
      different periods during the vine growing season, were shown to better
      describe crop status with respect to raw datasets by correlation analysis
      and ANOVA. In addition, using a K-means based classifier, 3-class vineyard
      vigor maps were profitably derived from the NDVI maps, which are a
      valuable tool for growers.

      provide these linkages, yet, cover cropping has not been analyzed
      extensively in remote sensing research. Methods used for remote sensing of
      crops from satellites traditionally leverage the difference between
      visible and near-infrared reflectance to isolate the signal of
      photosynthetically active vegetation. However, using traditional greenness
      indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for
      remotely sensing winter vegetation, such as winter cover crops, is
      challenging because vegetation reflectance signals are often confounded
      with reflectance of bare soil and crop residues. Here, we present new and
      established methods of detecting winter cover crops using remote sensing
      observations. We find that remote sensing methods that incorporate thermal
      data in addition to traditional reflectance metrics are best able to
      distinguish between winter farm management practices. We conclude by
      addressing the potential of existing and upcoming hyperspectral and
      thermal missions to further assess agroecosystem function in the context
      of global change.

AB  - This research is an outcome of the R&D activities of Ecodevelopment S.A.
      (steadily supported by the Hellenic Agricultural Organization—Demeter)
      towards offering precision farming services to rice growers. Within this
      framework, a new methodology for topdressing nitrogen prediction was
      developed based on machine learning. Nitrogen is a key element in rice
      culture and its rational management can increase productivity, reduce
      costs, and prevent environmental impacts. A multi-source, multi-temporal,
      and multi-scale dataset was collected, including optical and radar
      imagery, soil data, and yield maps by monitoring a 110 ha pilot rice farm
      in Thessaloniki Plain, Greece, for four consecutive years. RapidEye
      imagery underwent image segmentation to delineate management zones
      (ancillary, visual interpretation of unmanned aerial system scenes was
      employed, too); Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery was modelled with Computer Vision
      to detect inundated fields and (through this) indicate the exact growth
      stage of the crop; and Sentinel-2 image data were used to map leaf
      nitrogen concentration (LNC) exactly before topdressing applications.
      Several machine learning algorithms were configured to predict yield for
      various nitrogen levels, with the XGBoost model resulting in the highest
      accuracy. Finally, yield curves were used to select the nitrogen dose
      maximizing yield, which was thus recommended to the grower. Inundation
      mapping proved to be critical in the prediction process. Currently,
      Ecodevelopment S.A. is expanding the application of the new method in
      different study areas, with a view to further empower its generality and
      operationality.

AB  - Conservation tillage methods through leaving the crop residue cover (CRC)
      on the soil surface protect it from water and wind erosions. Hence, the
      percentage of the CRC on the soil surface is very critical for the
      evaluation of tillage intensity. The objective of this study was to
      develop a new methodology based on the semiautomated fuzzy object based
      image analysis (fuzzy OBIA) and compare its efficiency with two machine
      learning algorithms which include: support vector machine (SVM) and
      artificial neural network (ANN) for the evaluation of the previous CRC and
      tillage intensity. We also considered the spectral images from two
      remotely sensed platforms of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and
      Sentinel-2 satellite, respectively. The results indicated that fuzzy OBIA
      for multispectral Sentinel-2 image based on Gaussian membership function
      with overall accuracy and Cohen’s kappa of 0.920 and 0.874, respectively,
      surpassed machine learning algorithms and represented the useful results
      for the classification of tillage intensity. The results also indicated
      that overall accuracy and Cohen’s kappa for the classification of RGB
      images from the UAV using fuzzy OBIA method were 0.860 and 0.779,
      respectively. The semiautomated fuzzy OBIA clearly outperformed machine
      learning approaches in estimating the CRC and the classification of the
      tillage methods and also it has the potential to substitute or complement
      field techniques.

AB  - Measurement of plant characteristics is still the primary bottleneck in
      both plant breeding and crop management. Rapid and accurate acquisition of
      information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring plant
      health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years,
      high-throughput phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both
      remote sensing and machine learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors
      (e.g., high-resolution RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, chlorophyll
      fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)) allows a range of
      spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question.
      Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged
      as powerful tools for extracting useful biological information from image
      data. Together, these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological,
      structural, biophysical, and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus
      on the recent development of phenomics approaches in strawberry farming,
      particularly those utilizing remote sensing and machine learning, with an
      eye toward future prospects for strawberries in precision agriculture. The
      research discussed is broadly categorized according to strawberry traits
      related to (1) fruit/flower detection, fruit maturity, fruit quality,
      internal fruit attributes, fruit shape, and yield prediction; (2) leaf and
      canopy attributes; (3) water stress; and (4) pest and disease detection.
      Finally, we present a synthesis of the potential research opportunities
      and directions that could further promote the use of remote sensing and
      machine learning in strawberry farming.

AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series allows describing the rice
      phenological cycle by the backscattering time signature. Therefore, the
      advent of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 program expands studies of radar data
      (C-band) for rice monitoring at regional scales, due to the high temporal
      resolution and free data distribution. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
      model has reached state-of-the-art in the pattern recognition of
      time-sequenced data, obtaining a significant advantage at crop
      classification on the remote sensing images. One of the most used
      approaches in the RNN model is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and
      its improvements, such as Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). Bi-LSTM models are
      more effective as their output depends on the previous and the next
      segment, in contrast to the unidirectional LSTM models. The present
      research aims to map rice crops from Sentinel-1 time series (band C) using
      LSTM and Bi-LSTM models in West Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). We compared
      the results with traditional Machine Learning techniques: Support Vector
      Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Normal
      Bayes (NB). The developed methodology can be subdivided into the following
      steps: (a) acquisition of the Sentinel time series over two years; (b)
      data pre-processing and minimizing noise from 3D spatial-temporal filters
      and smoothing with Savitzky-Golay filter; (c) time series classification
      procedures; (d) accuracy analysis and comparison among the methods. The
      results show high overall accuracy and Kappa (>97% for all methods and
      metrics). Bi-LSTM was the best model, presenting statistical differences
      in the McNemar test with a significance of 0.05. However, LSTM and
      Traditional Machine Learning models also achieved high accuracy values.
      The study establishes an adequate methodology for mapping the rice crops
      in West Rio Grande do Sul.

      Observables Using Machine Learning

AB  - This study presents a demonstration of the applicability of machine
      learning techniques for the retrieval of crop height in corn fields using
      space-borne PolSAR (Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data.
      Multi-year RADARSAT-2 C-band data acquired over agricultural areas in
      Canada, covering the whole corn growing period, are exploited. Two popular
      machine learning regression methods, i.e., Random Forest Regression (RFR)
      and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are adopted and evaluated. A set of 27
      representative polarimetric parameters are extracted from the PolSAR data
      and used as input features in the regression models for height estimation.
      Furthermore, based on the unique capability of the RFR method to determine
      variable importance contributing to the regression, a smaller number of
      polarimetric features (6 out of 27 in our study) are selected in the final
      regression models. Results of our study demonstrate that PolSAR
      observables can produce corn height estimates with root mean square error
      (RMSE) around 40–50 cm throughout the growth cycle. The RFR approach shows
      better overall accuracy in corn height estimation than the SVR method in
      all tests. The six selected polarimetric features by variable importance
      ranking can generate better results. This study provides a new perspective
      on the use of PolSAR data in retrieving agricultural crop height from
      space.

AB  - Agroecosystem conditions limit the productivity of lowbush blueberry. Our
      objectives were to investigate the effects on berry yield of agroecosystem
      and crop management variables, then to develop a recommendation system to
      adjust nutrient and soil management of lowbush blueberry to given local
      meteorological conditions. We collected 1504 observations from N-P-K
      fertilizer trials conducted in Quebec, Canada. The data set, that
      comprised soil, tissue, and meteorological data, was processed by Bayesian
      mixed models, machine learning, compositional data analysis, and Markov
      chains. Our investigative statistical models showed that meteorological
      indices had the greatest impact on yield. High mean temperature at flower
      bud opening and after fruit maturation, and total precipitation at
      flowering stage showed positive effects. Low mean temperature and low
      total precipitation before bud opening, at flowering, and by fruit
      maturity, as well as number of freezing days (<−5 °C) before flower bud
      opening, showed negative effects. Soil and tissue tests, and N-P-K
      fertilization showed smaller effects. Gaussian processes predicted yields
      from historical weather data, soil test, fertilizer dosage, and tissue
      test with a root-mean-square-error of 1447 kg ha−1. An in-house Markov
      chain algorithm optimized yields modelled by Gaussian processes from
      tissue test, soil test, and fertilizer dosage as conditioned to specified
      historical meteorological features, potentially increasing yield by a
      median factor of 1.5. Machine learning, compositional data analysis, and
      Markov chains allowed customizing nutrient management of lowbush blueberry
      at local scale.

AB  - Proximal sensing techniques can potentially survey soil and crop variables
      responsible for variations in crop yield. The full potential of these
      precision agriculture technologies may be exploited in combination with
      innovative methods of data processing such as machine learning (ML)
      algorithms for the extraction of useful information responsible for
      controlling crop yield. Four ML algorithms, namely linear regression (LR),
      elastic net (EN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector regression
      (SVR), were used to predict potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber yield from
      data of soil and crop properties collected through proximal sensing. Six
      fields in Atlantic Canada including three fields in Prince Edward Island
      (PE) and three fields in New Brunswick (NB) were sampled, over two (2017
      and 2018) growing seasons, for soil electrical conductivity, soil moisture
      content, soil slope, normalized-difference vegetative index (NDVI), and
      soil chemistry. Data were collected from 39–40 30 × 30 m2 locations in
      each field, four times throughout the growing season, and yield samples
      were collected manually at the end of the growing season. Four datasets,
      namely PE-2017, PE-2018, NB-2017, and NB-2018, were then formed by combing
      data points from three fields to represent the province data for the
      respective years. Modeling techniques were employed to generate yield
      predictions assessed with different statistical parameters. The SVR models
      outperformed all other models for NB-2017, NB-2018, PE-2017, and PE-2018
      dataset with RMSE of 5.97, 4.62, 6.60, and 6.17 t/ha, respectively. The
      performance of k-NN remained poor in three out of four datasets, namely
      NB-2017, NB-2018, and PE-2017 with RMSE of 6.93, 5.23, and 6.91 t/ha,
      respectively. The study also showed that large datasets are required to
      generate useful results using either model. This information is needed for
      creating site-specific management zones for potatoes, which form a
      significant component for food security initiatives across the globe.

AB  - Quantifying crop residue cover (CRC) on field surfaces is important for
      monitoring the tillage intensity and promoting sustainable management.
      Remote-sensing-based techniques have proven practical for determining CRC,
      however, the methods used are primarily limited to empirical regression
      based on crop residue indices (CRIs). This study provides a systematic
      evaluation of empirical regressions and machine learning (ML) algorithms
      based on their ability to estimate CRC using Sentinel-2 Multispectral
      Instrument (MSI) data. Unmanned aerial vehicle orthomosaics were used to
      extracted ground CRC for training Sentinel-2 data-based CRC models. For
      empirical regression, nine MSI bands, 10 published CRIs, three proposed
      CRIs, and four mean textural features were evaluated using univariate
      linear regression. The best performance was obtained by a three-band index
      calculated using (B2 − B4)/(B2 − B12), with an R2cv of 0.63 and RMSEcv of
      6.509%, using a 10-fold cross-validation. The methodologies of partial
      least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural network (ANN), Gaussian
      process regression (GPR), support vector regression (SVR), and random
      forest (RF) were compared with four groups of predictors, including nine
      MSI bands, 13 CRIs, a combination of MSI bands and mean textural features,
      and a combination of CRIs and textural features. In general, ML approaches
      achieved high accuracy. A PLSR model with 13 CRIs and textural features
      resulted in an accuracy of R2cv = 0.66 and RMSEcv = 6.427%. An RF model
      with predictors of MSI bands and textural features estimated CRC with an
      R2cv = 0.61 and RMSEcv = 6.415%. The estimation was improved by an SVR
      model with the same input predictors (R2cv = 0.67, RMSEcv = 6.343%),
      followed by a GPR model based on CRIs and textural features. The
      performance of GPR models was further improved by optimal input variables.
      A GPR model with six input variables, three MSI bands and three textural
      features, performed the best, with R2cv = 0.69 and RMSEcv = 6.149%. This
      study provides a reference for estimating CRC from Sentinel-2 imagery
      using ML approaches. The GPR approach is recommended. A combination of
      spectral information and textural features leads to an improvement in the
      retrieval of CRC.

AB  - Non-destructive crop monitoring over large areas with high efficiency is
      of great significance in precision agriculture and plant phenotyping, as
      well as decision making with regards to grain policy and food security.
      The goal of this research was to assess the potential of combining canopy
      spectral information with canopy structure features for crop monitoring
      using satellite/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data fusion and machine
      learning. Worldview-2/3 satellite data were tasked synchronized with
      high-resolution RGB image collection using an inexpensive unmanned aerial
      vehicle (UAV) at a heterogeneous soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) field.
      Canopy spectral information (i.e., vegetation indices) was extracted from
      Worldview-2/3 data, and canopy structure information (i.e., canopy height
      and canopy cover) was derived from UAV RGB imagery. Canopy spectral and
      structure information and their combination were used to predict soybean
      leaf area index (LAI), aboveground biomass (AGB), and leaf nitrogen
      concentration (N) using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random
      forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and extreme
      learning regression (ELR) with a newly proposed activation function. The
      results revealed that: (1) UAV imagery-derived high-resolution and
      detailed canopy structure features, canopy height, and canopy coverage
      were significant indicators for crop growth monitoring, (2) integration of
      satellite imagery-based rich canopy spectral information with UAV-derived
      canopy structural features using machine learning improved soybean AGB,
      LAI, and leaf N estimation on using satellite or UAV data alone, (3)
      adding canopy structure information to spectral features reduced
      background soil effect and asymptotic saturation issue to some extent and
      led to better model performance, (4) the ELR model with the newly proposed
      activated function slightly outperformed PLSR, RFR, and SVR in the
      prediction of AGB and LAI, while RFR provided the best result for N
      estimation. This study introduced opportunities and limitations of
      satellite/UAV data fusion using machine learning in the context of crop
      monitoring.

AB  - Long-term temporal and spatial information of crop type supports a wid

ies. In the U.S., yearly crop data layers (CDLs) are available startin
g in the early 2000s and have been developed using combined field info

t of long-term crop-type layers similar to CDLs is restricted by reduc
ed accessibility to imagery and the necessary auxiliary datasets. In t
his study, a procedure to generate a historical crop type was develope
d and evaluated. Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
 (NDVI) datasets from Landsat 5 TM sensor for the Lower Bear Creek wat

ves, represented by the NDVI time series, were generated using noise f
iltering and dimensionality standardization procedures for the years 1
985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Classifiers were developed and evalua
ted using random-forest machine learning algorithms and CDL datasets a
s the reference. Increased generalization performance was obtained whe
n the model was developed using multi-year datasets. This can be attri
buted to improved crop type representation during the training phase c
oupled with characterization of yearly variations due to natural (weat
her) and anthropogenic factors (farming management). Source of uncerta
inties were the presence of multiple crops within objects, phenologica

 itself. The proposed procedure supports the development of historic c

AB  - The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (BPH) is one of the most harmful
      insect pests in rice paddy fields, which causes considerable yield loss
      and consequent economic problems, particularly in the central plain of
      Thailand. Accurate and timely forecasting of pest population incidence
      would support farmers in planning effective mitigation. In this study,
      artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and classic linear
      multiple regression (MLR) analyses were applied and compared to forecast
      the BPH population using weather and host-plant phenology factors during
      the crop dry season from 2006 to 2016 in the central plain of Thailand.
      Data from satellite earth observation was used to monitor crop phenology
      factors affecting BPH population density. An ANN model with integrated
      ground-based meteorological variables and satellite-derived host plant
      variables was more accurate for short-term forecasting of the peak
      abundance of BPH when compared with RF and MLR, according to a reasonably
      validating dataset (RMSE of natural log-transformed (ln) BPH light trap
      catches = 1.686, 1.737, and 2.015, respectively). This finding indicates
      that the utilization of ground meteorological observations,
      satellite-derived NDVI time series, and ANN have the potential to predict
      BPH population density in support of integrated pest management programs.
      We expect the results from this study can be applied in conjunction with
      the satellite-based rice monitoring system developed by the Geo-Informatic
      and Space Technology Development Agency of Thailand (GISTDA) to support an
      effective pest early warning system.

      and UAV Images
T2  - Applied Sciences

DA  - 2019
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that can provide thematic information
      at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions than satellite images have
      great potential in crop classification. Due to the ultra-high spatial
      resolution of UAV images, spatial contextual information such as texture
      is often used for crop classification. From a data availability viewpoint,
      it is not always possible to acquire time-series UAV images due to limited
      accessibility to the study area. Thus, it is necessary to improve
      classification performance for situations when a single or minimum number
      of UAV images are available for crop classification. In this study, we
      investigate the potential of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based
      texture information for crop classification with time-series UAV images
      and machine learning classifiers including random forest and support
      vector machine. In particular, the impact of combining texture and
      spectral information on the classification performance is evaluated for
      cases that use only one UAV image or multi-temporal images as input. A
      case study of crop classification in Anbandegi of Korea was conducted for
      the above comparisons. The best classification accuracy was achieved when
      multi-temporal UAV images which can fully account for the growth cycles of
      crops were combined with GLCM-based texture features. However, the impact
      of the utilization of texture information was not significant. In
      contrast, when one August UAV image was used for crop classification, the
      utilization of texture information significantly affected the
      classification performance. Classification using texture features
      extracted from GLCM with larger kernel size significantly improved
      classification accuracy, an improvement of 7.72%p in overall accuracy for
      the support vector machine classifier, compared with classification based
      solely on spectral information. These results indicate the usefulness of
      texture information for classification of ultra-high-spatial-resolution
      UAV images, particularly when acquisition of time-series UAV images is
      difficult and only one UAV image is used for crop classification.

AB  - Large-scale crop mapping provides important information in agricultural
      applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the inconsistent
      availability of remote sensing data caused by the irregular time series
      and limited coverage of the images, together with the low spatial
      resolution of the classification results. In this study, we proposed a new
      efficient method based on grids to address the inconsistent availability
      of the high-medium resolution images for large-scale crop classification.
      First, we proposed a method to block the remote sensing data into grids to
      solve the problem of temporal inconsistency. Then, a parallel computing
      technique was introduced to improve the calculation efficiency on the grid
      scale. Experiments were designed to evaluate the applicability of this
      method for different high-medium spatial resolution remote sensing images
      and different machine learning algorithms and to compare the results with
      the widely used nonparallel method. The computational experiments showed
      that the proposed method was successful at identifying large-scale crop
      distribution using common high-medium resolution remote sensing images
      (GF-1 WFV images and Sentinel-2) and common machine learning classifiers
      (the random forest algorithm and support vector machine). Finally, we
      mapped the croplands in Heilongjiang Province in 2015, 2016, 2017, which
      used a random forest classifier with the time series GF-1 WFV images
      spectral features, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized
      difference water index (NDWI). Ultimately, the accuracy was assessed using
      a confusion matrix. The results showed that the classification accuracy
      reached 88%, 82%, and 85% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. In
      addition, with the help of parallel computing, the calculation speed was
      significantly improved by at least seven-fold. This indicates that using
      the grid framework to block the data for classification is feasible for
      crop mapping in large areas and has great application potential in the
      future.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Spectral Library for Crop Classification and Status
      Monitoring

AB  - The establishment and application of a spectral library is a critical step
      in the standardization and automation of remote sensing interpretation and
      mapping. Currently, most spectral libraries are designed to support the
      classification of land cover types, whereas few are dedicated to
      agricultural remote sensing monitoring. Here, we gathered spectral
      observation data on plants in multiple experimental scenarios into a
      spectral database to investigate methods for crop classification (16 crop
      species) and status monitoring (tea plant and rice growth). We proposed a
      set of screening methods for spectral features related to plant
      classification and status monitoring (band reflectance, vegetation index,
      spectral differentiation, spectral continuum characteristics) that are
      based on ISODATA and JM distance. Next, we investigated the performance of
      different machine learning classifiers in the spectral library
      application, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and a
      genetic algorithm coupled with a support vector machine (GA-SVM). The
      optimal combination of spectral features and the classifier with the
      highest classification accuracy were selected for crop classification and
      status monitoring scenarios. The GA-SVM classifier performed the best,
      which produced an accuracy of OAA = 0.94, Kappa = 0.93 for crop
      classification in a complex scenario (crops mixed with 71 non-crop plant
      species), and promising accuracies for tea plant growth monitoring (OAA =
      0.98, Kappa = 0.97) and rice growth stage monitoring (OAA = 0.92, Kappa =
      0.90). Therefore, the establishment of a plant spectral library combined
      with relevant feature extraction and a classification algorithm
      effectively supports agricultural monitoring by remote sensing.

PY  - 2021

AB  - Advances in spaceborne hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing, cloud-computing,
      and machine learning can help measure, model, map and monitor agricultural
      crops to address global food and water security issues, such as by
      providing accurate estimates of crop area and yield to model agricultural
      productivity. Leveraging these advances, we used the Earth Observing-1
      (EO-1) Hyperion historical archive and the new generation DLR Earth
      Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) data to evaluate the performance of
      hyperspectral narrowbands in classifying major agricultural crops of the
      U.S. with machine learning (ML) on Google Earth Engine (GEE). EO-1
      Hyperion images from the 2010–2013 growing seasons and DESIS images from
      the 2019 growing season were used to classify three world crops (corn,
      soybean, and winter wheat) along with other crops and non-crops near Ponca
      City, Oklahoma, USA. The supervised classification algorithms: Random
      Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB), and the
      unsupervised clustering algorithm WekaXMeans (WXM) were run using selected
      optimal Hyperion and DESIS HS narrowbands (HNBs). RF and SVM returned the
      highest overall producer’s, and user’s accuracies, with the performances
      of NB and WXM being substantially lower. The best accuracies were achieved
      with two or three images throughout the growing season, especially a
      combination of an earlier month (June or July) and a later month (August
      or September). The narrow 2.55 nm bandwidth of DESIS provided numerous
      spectral features along the 400–1000 nm spectral range relative to
      smoother Hyperion spectral signatures with 10 nm bandwidth in the 400–2500
      nm spectral range. Out of 235 DESIS HNBs, 29 were deemed optimal for
      agricultural study. Advances in ML and cloud-computing can greatly
      facilitate HS data analysis, especially as more HS datasets, tools, and
      algorithms become available on the Cloud.

AB  - Advanced machine learning techniques have been used in remote sensing (RS)
      applications such as crop mapping and yield prediction, but remain
      under-utilized for tracking crop progress. In this study, we demonstrate
      the use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term
      Memory-based, domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop
      progress estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to
      separate independent crop growth drivers and captures their varying
      importance throughout the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for
      corn, using RS data in Iowa, U.S., for the period 2003–2019, with United
      States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop progress reports used as
      ground truth. State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement
      over sequential and dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden
      Markov Model method. The DgNN had a 4.0% higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
      over all growth stages and 39% more weeks with highest cosine similarity
      than the next best NN during test years. The DgNN and Sequential NN were
      more robust during periods of abnormal crop progress, though estimating
      the Silking–Grainfill transition was difficult for all methods. Finally,
      Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection visualizations of layer
      activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop growth time-series
      differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this study exhibit
      both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE) and the
      benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here
      can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops.

AB  - Global food security is critical to eliminating hunger and malnutrition.
      In the changing climate, farmers in developing countries must adopt
      technologies and farming practices such as precision agriculture (PA).
      PA-based approaches enable farmers to cope with frequent and intensified
      droughts and heatwaves, optimising yields, increasing efficiencies, and
      reducing operational costs. Biophysical parameters such as Leaf Area Index
      (LAI), Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCab), and Canopy Chlorophyll Content
      (CCC) are essential for characterising field-level spatial variability and
      thus are necessary for enabling variable rate application technologies,
      precision irrigation, and crop monitoring. Moreover, robust machine
      learning algorithms offer prospects for improving the estimation of
      biophysical parameters due to their capability to deal with non-linear
      data, small samples, and noisy variables. This study compared the
      predictive performance of sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS), Random
      Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) for estimating LAI,
      LCab, and CCC with Sentinel-2 imagery in Bothaville, South Africa and
      identified, using variable importance measures, the most influential bands
      for estimating crop biophysical parameters. The results showed that RF was
      superior in estimating all three biophysical parameters, followed by GBM
      which was better in estimating LAI and CCC, but not LCab, where sPLS was
      relatively better. Since all biophysical parameters could be achieved with
      RF, it can be considered a good contender for operationalisation. Overall,
      the findings in this study are significant for future biophysical product
      development using RF to reduce reliance on many algorithms for specific
      parameters, thus facilitating the rapid extraction of actionable
      information to support PA and crop monitoring activities.

AB  - Hailstorms usually result in total crop loss. After a hailstorm, the
      affected field is inspected by an insurance claims adjuster to assess
      yield loss. Assessment accuracy depends largely on in situ detection of
      homogeneous damage sectors within the field, using visual techniques. This
      paper presents an algorithm for the automatic detection of homogeneous
      hail damage through the application of unsupervised machine learning
      techniques to vegetation indices calculated from remote sensing data. Five
      microwave and five spectral indices were evaluated before and after a
      hailstorm in zones with different degrees of damage. Dual Polarization SAR
      Vegetation Index and Normalized Pigment Chlorophyll Ratio Index were the
      most sensitive to hail-induced changes. The time series and rates of
      change of these indices were used as input variables in the K-means method
      for clustering pixels into homogeneous damage zones. Validation of the
      algorithm with data from 91 soybean, wheat, and corn plots showed that in
      87.01% of cases there was significant evidence of differences in average
      damage between zones determined by the algorithm within the plot. Thus,
      the algorithm presented in this paper allowed efficient detection of
      homogeneous hail damage zones, which is expected to improve accuracy and
      transparency in the characterization of hailstorm events.

      system and implemented an algorithm for the 3D image reconstruction of red
      pepper plant (Capsicum annuum L.), as well as its automatic analysis. A
      Kinect v2 with a depth sensor and a high-resolution RGB camera were used
      to obtain more accurate reconstructed 3D images. The reconstructed 3D
      images were compared with conventional reconstructed images, and the data
      of the reconstructed images were analyzed with respect to their directly
      measured features and accuracy, such as leaf number, width, and plant
      height. Several algorithms for image extraction and segmentation were
      applied for automatic analysis. The results showed that the proposed
      method showed an error of about 5 mm or less when reconstructing and
      analyzing 3D images, and was suitable for phenotypic analysis. The images
      and analysis algorithms obtained by the 3D reconstruction method are
      expected to be applied to various image processing studies.

      (r2 of 0.72, 0.65 and 0.67 respectively) between predicted and measured

AB  - Crop diseases constitute a serious issue in agriculture, affecting both
      quality and quantity of agriculture production. Disease control has been a
      research object in many scientific and technologic domains. Technological
      advances in sensors, data storage, computing resources and artificial
      intelligence have shown enormous potential to control diseases
      effectively. A growing body of literature recognizes the importance of
      using data from different types of sensors and machine learning approaches
      to build models for detection, prediction, analysis, assessment, etc.
      However, the increasing number and diversity of research studies requires
      a literature review for further developments and contributions in this
      area. This paper reviews state-of-the-art machine learning methods that
      use different data sources, applied to plant disease detection. It lists
      traditional and deep learning methods associated with the main data
      acquisition modalities, namely IoT, ground imaging, unmanned aerial
      vehicle imaging and satellite imaging. In addition, this study examines
      the role of data fusion for ongoing research in the context of disease
      detection. It highlights the advantage of intelligent data fusion

AB  - Optimal crop emergence is an important trait in crop breeding for
      genotypic screening and for achieving potential growth and yield.
      Emergence is conventionally quantified manually by counting the
      sub-sections of field plots or scoring; these are less reliable, laborious
      and inefficient. Remote sensing technology is being increasingly used for
      high-throughput estimation of agronomic traits in field crops. This study
      developed a method for estimating wheat seedlings using multispectral
      images captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle. A machine learning
      regression (MLR) analysis was used by combining spectral and morphological
      information extracted from the multispectral images. The approach was
      tested on diverse wheat genotypes varying in seedling emergence. In this
      study, three supervised MLR models including regression trees, support
      vector regression and Gaussian process regression (GPR) were evaluated for
      estimating wheat seedling emergence. The GPR model was the most effective
      compared to the other methods, with R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 4.07 and MAE = 3.21
      when correlated to the manual seedling count. In addition, imagery data
      collected at multiple flight altitudes and different wheat growth stages
      suggested that 10 m altitude and 20 days after sowing were desirable for
      optimal spatial resolution and image analysis. The method is deployable on
      larger field trials and other crops for effective and reliable seedling
      emergence estimates.

AB  - COVID-19, which emerged in January 2020, has affected almost all sectors
      of the economy. Agriculture sector also contributes in controlling the
      economy on a large scale. Social distancing is the only effective way to
      prevent the corona virus. In order to implement social distancing, more
      than 80 countries around the world have implemented the provision of
      lockdown. The lockdown has affected almost all sectors of the world, such
      as education, travel and hospitality, and agricultural imports and
      exports. This paper calculates the impact on the agriculture sector due to
      the lockdown under COVID-19 using a machine learning regression model. To
      understand the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture, we took a case study of
      one of the major agricultural countries, INDIA, and studied the impact
      using datasets collected from various sources. A significant positive
      relationship between food inflation, import goods and export commodities
      has been revealed by the results of data collision. This indicates that
      the decline in imports and exports of goods has led to a spurt in food
      inflation.

AB  - A lack of sufficient training data, both in terms of variety and quantity,
      is often the bottleneck in the development of machine learning (ML)
      applications in any domain. For agricultural applications, ML-based models
      designed to perform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will
      typically be coupled to just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a
      consequence, each crop-specific task is very likely to require its own
      specialized training data, and the question of how to serve this need for
      data now often overshadows the more routine exercise of actually training
      such models. To tackle this problem, we have developed an embedded robotic
      system to automatically generate and label large datasets of plant images
      for ML applications in agriculture. The system can image plants from
      virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide variety of data; and with an
      imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can produce lableled
      datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of images per day.
      As such, this system offers an important alternative to time- and
      cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the
      use of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional
      image processing techniques such as background replacement and image
      segementation. It also helps in the training process, essentially forcing
      the model to focus on the plant features and eliminating random
      correlations. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we generated
      a dataset of over 34,000 labeled images, with which we trained an ML-model
      to distinguish grasses from non-grasses in test data from a variety of
      sources. We now plan to generate much larger datasets of Canadian crop
      plants and weeds that will be made publicly available in the hope of
      further enabling ML applications in the agriculture sector.

      and propose a novel system for the quality assessment of organic

      extreme gradient boosting, were used with data from both pXRF and
      DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy. Cross-validation trials were run to evaluate
      generalizability of models produced on each instrument. Both methods
      demonstrated similar broad capabilities in estimating nutrients using
      machine learning, with pXRF being suitable for nutrients and contaminants.

AB  - A quantitative understanding of the hydro-environmental factors that
      influence the occurrence of agricultural drought events would enable more
      strategic climate change adaptation and drought management plans.
      Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible
      exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of
      inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This
      research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard
      with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification
      and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random
      forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible
      discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM).
      Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure
      of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone
      southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994–2013. RDSM was then
      used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight
      hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought.
      The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were
      evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent
      methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E),
      F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
      (AUC-ROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score
      = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the FDA model (with AUC-ROC =
      73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst
      performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean
      annual precipitation, and clay content were the most important variables
      to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the
      area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant
      drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do
      not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year;
      the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events,
      despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among
      events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall
      risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency
      planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where
      drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key
      practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.

AB  - Agricultural drought is a natural hazard arising from insufficient crop
      water supply. Many drought indices have been developed to characterize
      agricultural drought, relying on either ground-based climate data or
      various remotely-sensed drought proxies. Ground-based drought indices are
      more accurate but limited in coverage, while remote sensing drought
      indices cover large areas but have poor precision. Application of advanced
      data fusion approaches based on remotely-sensed data to estimate
      ground-based drought indices may help fill this gap. The overall objective
      of this study was to determine whether various remotely-sensed drought
      factors could be effectively used for monitoring agricultural drought in
      south-eastern Australia. In this study, thirty remotely-sensed drought
      factors from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the
      Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors
      were used to reproduce a ground-based drought index, SPEI (Standardized
      Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) during 2001–2017 for the New South
      Wales wheat belt in south-eastern Australia. Three advanced machine
      learning methods, i.e. bias-corrected random forest, support vector
      machine, and multi-layer perceptron neural network, were adopted as the
      regression models in this procedure. A station-based historical climate
      dataset and observed wheat yields were used as reference data to evaluate
      the performance of the model-predicted SPEI in reflecting agricultural
      drought. Results show that the bias-corrected random forest model
      outperformed the other two models for SPEI prediction, as quantified by
      the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (<0.28
      and 0.9, respectively). Drought distribution maps produced by the
      bias-corrected random forest model were then compared with the
      station-based drought maps, showing strong visual and statistical
      agreement. Furthermore, the model-predicted SPEI values were more highly
      correlated with observed wheat yields than the station-based SPEI. The
      method used in this study is effective and fast, and based on data that
      are readily available. It can be easily extended to other cropping areas
      to produce a rapid overview of drought conditions and to enhance the
      present capabilities of real-time drought monitoring.

AB  - Since the invention of the computer, all available information in every
      field has been digitized and made available to people who use computer
      resources. As a result, massive amounts of data are being generated in
      every domain at an alarming rate. Agriculture is one such area of interest
      for researchers. Machine learning is the process of extracting useful
      information from various types of data. The classification of objects is
      an important area within the field of data mining, and its application
      extends to a variety of areas, whether or not in the field of science.
      Although k-Nearest Neighbor classification is a simple and effective
      technique, it slows down the classification of each object. Furthermore,
      the classification’s effectiveness suffers as a result of the uneven
      distribution of training data. The purpose of this paper is to look into
      the applicability of various machine learning techniques in agriculture.

AB  - Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is a complex and non-linear process difficult to measure and estimate accurately. This complexity can be solved applying the machine learning techniques with different meteorological input variables. This study investigated the performance of k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) models to predict daily potato ETc using four scenarios of available meteorological data as: air temperature (scenario 1), air temperature and solar radiation (scenario 2), air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed (scenario 3), and air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity (scenarios 4). The analysis was based on the results of experimental trials carried out in Southern Italy in 2009 and 2010 and focussed on the potato crop cultivation under optimal water supply. The results of ETc estimation with different machine learning techniques were compared with ETc obtained from the soil water balance model, based on the FAO Penman Monteith approach, and gravimetric measurements of soil water content in the crop root zone. The best performances were observed with the kNN model with R2 of 0.813, 0.968 and 0.965, slope of regression 0.947, 0.980 and 0.991, modelling efficiency (EF) of 0.848, 0.970 and 0.972, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.790, 0.351 and 0.355 mm day−1, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.563, 0.263 and 0.274 mm day−1 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.623, 0.123 and 0.126 mm day−1 for scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. When all meteorological variables were available (scenario 4), the ANN model produced slightly better statistical indicators. Therefore, the kNN model could be recommended for the estimation of ETc when limited meteorological data are available. Otherwise, the ANN model should be applied.

AB  - Global food security is becoming increasingly stressed by growing populations and climate change. To compensate for these stresses, crop yields must increase throughout the upcoming century. One of the more prominently featured solutions entails genetically modified crops, but their impacts on yields are contested. Here, we leverage machine learning techniques to examine the effects genetically modified crops have had on US corn yields. In particular, a principal components analysis conducted on US Midwest county yields reveals that the commercialization of genetically modified corn accentuated preexisting spatial disparities in production and explains approximately 6–12% of the region's inter-county variation in yields from 1980 to 2015. Additionally, counterfactual yield trajectories predicted by Bayesian structural time series models using non-genetically modified crops as synthetic controls suggest that the adoption of this biotechnology amounted to an approximate 13% increase in overall US corn yields from 1996 to 2015.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in the last decades for agricultural applications, both for assessing vegetation condition and for subsequent yield prediction. Existing remote sensing-based methods to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP), which is an important variable to indicate crop photosynthetic function and stress, typically rely on empirical or semi-empirical approaches, which tend to over-simplify photosynthetic mechanisms. In this work, we take advantage of all parallel developments in mechanistic photosynthesis modeling and satellite data availability for an advanced monitoring of crop productivity. In particular, we combine process-based modeling with the soil-canopy energy balance radiative transfer model (SCOPE) with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical remote sensing data and machine learning methods in order to estimate crop GPP. With this approach, we by-pass the need for an intermediate step to retrieve the set of vegetation biophysical parameters needed to accurately model photosynthesis, while still accounting for the complex processes of the original physically-based model. Several implementations of the machine learning models are tested and validated using simulated and flux tower-based GPP data. Our final neural network model is able to estimate GPP at the tested flux tower sites with r2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.38 gC d−1 m−2, which outperforms empirical models based on vegetation indices. The first test of applicability of this model to Landsat 8 data showed good results (r2 of 0.82 and RMSE of 1.97 gC d−1 m−2), which suggests that our approach can be further applied to other sensors. Modeling and testing is restricted to C3 crops in this study, but can be extended to C4 crops by producing a new training dataset with SCOPE that accounts for the different photosynthetic pathways. Our model successfully estimates GPP across a variety of C3 crop types and environmental conditions even though it does not use any local information from the corresponding sites. This highlights its potential to map crop productivity from new satellite sensors at a global scale with the help of current Earth observation cloud computing platforms.

AB  - Cover crop is an agriculture operation that is planted during the winter and owns several advantages such as improving water quality and soil quality. However, the large-scale effect of cover crop in relieving environmental burden and improving cash crop yield over a region has not been widely investigated. Due to cost and time limitation, it is not favorable to conduct the conventional field trials. Previous study proposed a Random Forest classifier to predict the pattern of cover crop adoption from the remote sensing data. In this study, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron neural network to further improve the performance and reliability of the classification model and achieve an accuracy of 0.93 and Cohen’s Kappa of 0.76. Moreover, the Multilayer Perceptron model outperforms two baseline classification models. Finally, we predict the cover crop planting status for the Knox County and found a significant increase in cover crop planting on the corn cropland in 2016.

AB  - Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) are essential tools for estimating agricultural crop yields and externalities at large scales, typically at coarse spatial resolutions. Higher resolution estimates are required for robust agricultural assessments at regional and local scales, where the applicability of GGCMs is often limited by low data availability and high computational demand. An approach to bridge this gap is the application of meta-models trained on GGCM output data to covariates of high spatial resolution. In this study, we explore two machine learning approaches – extreme gradient boosting and random forests - to develop meta-models for the prediction of crop model outputs at fine spatial resolutions. Machine learning algorithms are trained on global scale maize simulations of a GGCM and exemplary applied to the extent of Mexico at a finer spatial resolution. Results show very high accuracy with R2>0.96 for predictions of maize yields as well as the hydrologic externalities evapotranspiration and crop available water with also low mean bias in all cases. While limited sets of covariates such as annual climate data alone provide satisfactory results already, a comprehensive set of predictors covering annual, growing season, and monthly climate data is required to obtain high performance in reproducing climate-driven inter-annual crop yield variability. The findings presented herein provide a first proof of concept that machine learning methods are highly suitable for building crop meta-models for spatio-temporal downscaling and indicate potential for further developments towards scalable crop model emulators.

AB  - The organic banana is one of the most popular products worldwide and its popularity is mainly due to its excellent nutritional properties and tasty flavor. Peru is considered one of the major producers and exporters of this product, being the city of Piura the main region with most of the national agro-producers. It is also considered a key factor in the development of the economy of this region as it creates job opportunities because of the productive chain required in the process (harvest, post-harvest, and export). The main problem faced by producers is the existence of pests such as Red spot thrips, Black Sigatoka, and others, which affect the production and the quality of the final product. Therefore, this article aims to propose an alternative solution, using the 4.0 Industry technology as well as the installation of an IoT sensor network in banana plantations in order to develop a model which estimates the classification of the pest incidence level based on Machine learning techniques, making use of the atmospheric variables measured with the IoT sensor network as input data. In the research, we have used The Support Vector Machine techniques, which have successfully achieved models with a high level of accuracy. The implementation of this system aims to help producers improve the management of pest control by scheduling spraying dates more effectively, optimizing not only the quality of the product but also reducing costs.

AB  - Nitrogen is an essential nutrient that directly affects plant photosynthesis, crop yield, and biomass production for bioenergy crops, but excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers can cause environmental degradation. To achieve sustainable nitrogen fertilizer management for precision agriculture, there is an urgent need for nondestructive and high spatial resolution monitoring of crop nitrogen and its allocation to photosynthetic proteins as that changes over time. Here, we used visible to shortwave infrared (400–2400 nm) airborne hyperspectral imaging with high spatial (0.5 m) and spectral (3–5 nm) resolutions to accurately estimate critical crop traits, i.e., nitrogen, chlorophyll, and photosynthetic capacity (CO2-saturated photosynthesis rate, Vmax,27), at leaf and canopy scales, and to assess nitrogen deficiency on crop yield. We conducted three airborne campaigns over a maize (Zea mays L.) field during the growing season of 2019. Physically based soil-canopy Radiative Transfer Modeling (RTM) and data-driven approaches i.e. Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR) were used to retrieve crop traits from hyperspectral reflectance, with ground truth of leaf nitrogen, chlorophyll, Vmax,27, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and harvested grain yield. To improve computational efficiency of RTMs, Random Forest (RF) was used to mimic RTM simulations to generate machine learning surrogate models RTM-RF. The results show that prior knowledge of soil background and leaf angle distribution can significantly reduce the ill-posed RTM retrieval. RTM-RF achieved a high accuracy to predict leaf chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.73) and LAI (R2 = 0.75). Meanwhile, PLSR exhibited better accuracy to predict leaf chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.79), nitrogen concentration (R2 = 0.83), nitrogen content (R2 = 0.77), and Vmax,27 (R2 = 0.69) but required measured traits for model training. We also found that canopy structure signals can enhance the use of spectral data to predict nitrogen related photosynthetic traits, as combining RTM-RF LAI and PLSR leaf traits well predicted canopy-level traits (leaf traits × LAI) including canopy chlorophyll (R2 = 0.80), nitrogen (R2 = 0.85) and Vmax,27 (R2 = 0.82). Compared to leaf traits, we further found that canopy-level photosynthetic traits, particularly canopy Vmax,27, have higher correlation with maize grain yield. This study highlights the potential for synergistic use of process-based and data-driven approaches of hyperspectral imaging to quantify crop traits that facilitate precision agricultural management to secure food and bioenergy production.

AB  - A wide variety of methods exist nowadays to address the important problem of estimating crop yields from available remote sensing and climate data. Among the different approaches, machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly adopted, since they allow exploiting all the information on crop progress and environmental conditions and their relations with crop yield, achieving reliable and accurate estimations. However, interpreting the relationships learned by the ML models, and hence getting insights about the problem, remains a complex and usually unexplored task. Without accountability, confidence and trust in the ML models can be compromised. Here, we develop interpretable ML approaches for crop yield estimation that allow us investigating the most informative agro-ecological drivers and influencial regions learned by the models. We conduct a set of experiments to learn the selection of agro-ecological drivers leading to best estimations of main crops grown in Europe: corn, barley and wheat. As input data, we consider a variety of multi-scale Earth observation products sensitive to canopy greenness (e.g. EVI and LAI), its water-uptake dynamics (e.g. VOD) and available water (soil moisture), as well as climatic variables from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (e.g. temperature and radiation). Our results show that the best performances (R2>0.55 for corn and R2>0.8 for both barley and wheat) are obtained when descriptors of soil, vegetation, and atmosphere status are used as input in the ML models. This combination of variables outperforms the results obtained using single variables as inputs or all variables altogether. We then further analyze the relations of input features with crop yield in the developed models by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We show how the information learned by the GPR model allows us to identify atypical or anomalous crop seasons across the study region, and investigate the underlying factors behind crop progress and failure in Europe.

AB  - Understanding the development mechanism of drought events, characterization of future drought metrics, and its impact on crop yield is crucial to ensure food security globally, and more importantly, in South Asia. Therefore, the present study assessed the changes in future projected drought metrics and evaluated the future risk of yield reduction under drought intensity. We characterized the magnitude, intensity, and duration of future drought by means of the SPEI drought index using CMIP6 (Coupled Model Inter-comparison Phase-6) climate models. The impact of future drought on crop yield was quantified from the ISI-MP (Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project) crop model by a proposed non-linear ensemble of Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Results suggested that high drought magnitude with a longer drought duration is projected in some regions of South Asia while high drought intensity comes with a shorter duration. It was also found that Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India will experience a longer drought duration in the future. Our proposed ensemble machine learning (EML) approach had high predictive skill with a minimum value of RMSE (0.358–0.390), MAE (0.222–0.299), and a maximum value of R2 (0.705–0.918) compared to the stand-alone methods of RF and GBM for yield loss risk projection. The drought-driven impact on crop yield demonstrates a high risk of yield loss under extreme drought events, which will encounter 54.15%, 29.30%, and 50.66% loss in the future for rice, wheat, and maize crops, respectively. Furthermore, drought and yield loss risk dynamics suggested a one unit decrease in SPEI value would lead to a 14.2%, 7.5%, and 10.9% decrease in yield for rice, wheat, and maize crops, respectively. This study will provide a notable direction for policy agencies to build resistance to crop production against the drought impact in the regions that are critical to climate change.

AB  - Accurate prediction of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) is important for regional water resources management and optimal design of agricultural irrigation system. In this study, three hybrid models (PSO-ELM, GA-ELM and ABC-ELM) integrating the extreme learning machine model (ELM) with three biological heuristic algorithms, i.e., PSO, GA and ABC, were proposed for predicting daily ET0 based on daily meteorological data from 2000 to 2019 at twelve representative stations in different climatic zones of China. The performances of the three hybrid ELM models were further compared with the standalone ELM model and three empirical models (Hargreaves, Priestley-Talor and Makkink models). The results showed that the hybrid ELM models (R2 = 0.973–0.999) all performed better than the standalone ELM model (R2 = 0.955–0.989) in four climatic regions in China. The estimation accuracy of the empirical models was relatively lower, with R2 of 0.822–0.887 and RMSE of 0.381–1.951 mm/d. The R2 values of PSO-ELM, GA-ELM and ABC-ELM models were 0.993, 0.986 and 0.981 and the RMSE values were 0.266 mm/d, 0.306 mm/d and 0.404 mm/d, respectively, indicating that the PSO-ELM model had the best performance. When setting Tmax, Tmin and RH as the model inputs, the PSO-ELM model presented better performance in the temperate continental zone (TCZ), subtropical monsoon region (SMZ) and temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) climate zones, with R2 of 0.892, 0866 and 0.870 and RMSE of 0.773 mm/d, 0.597 mm/d and 0.832 mm/d, respectively. The PSO-ELM model also performed in the mountain plateau region (MPZ) when only Tmax and Tmin data were available, with R2 of 0.808 and RMSE of 0.651 mm/d. All the three biological heuristic algorithms effectively improved the performance of the ELM model. Particularly, the PSO-ELM was recommended as a promising model realizing the high-precision estimation of daily ET0 with fewer meteorological parameters in different climatic zones of China.

AB  - Modern agriculture is based on control and optimization, where monitoring is essential. But yield monitoring limited to spatial mapping of biomass is unsatisfactory for uniformity optimization. Acquiring this information as soon as during the harvest could improve efficiency of precision agriculture. Current machine vision solutions do not allow this for several reasons, starting with difficulties with recognition of heavily cluttered, often mutually occluding objects, or requirements for elaborate hardware. Acquiring images in on-line conditions often results in perspective distortion which makes measurement difficult. This is even more challenging in the case of root crops, as they are usually graded basing on their minimal diameter, which is not directly observable via monocular vision. We propose a method for developing yield monitoring systems that can estimate physical dimensions of crops directly on-line. In our approach, individual plants are segmented using Mask R-CNN, allowing clear separation even in heavily cluttered conditions and in the presence of occlusions. Then, a nonlinear regression model is used to predict the minimal diameter of each plant basing on their observed contours. This model is capable of jointly correcting the perspective distortion and estimate the non-observed dimension. Training this model requires per-object annotations with their true diameters. Since this information is very difficult to acquire for real crops, we build a simulation environment where we model the crops, eventually rendering a synthetic dataset to train the regression model on. The size estimation model transfers the knowledge from simulated data, correctly predicting the sizes of real plants. We demonstrate our method on the case of potatoes, but it can be applied to other crops as well.

AB  - A country’s food needs mainly depend upon its agriculture resources and require reliable information related to crop health, distribution, and acreage estimation to manage and monitor resources to implement a sustainable agricultural system. Different methodologies have been used to collect this information. However, the availability of earth resource satellite data with improved spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, such as the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program satellites Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2), are creating more practicability to generate crop type maps. S1 and S2, both operating in a constellation of twin satellites, carry a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multispectral Instrument (MSI). Vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH), and vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) channels of S1 were used to exploit the temporal backscatter of crops present in the study area. In this research, a machine learning random forest classification algorithm is used for accurate crop type mapping through the combination of SAR (S1) and optical (S2) time-series data. Random forest classifier has produced considerable improved accuracies of crop type mapping in previous studies as it uses ensemble decision trees trained on sample data which permit the vote in favor of the most popular land use/ land cover class. The key objectives of this study are to investigate the classification accuracies for different data combinations. Three plots of data are tested (i) S1 (ii) S2 (iii) S1 & S2. A combination of SAR and optical data turn out with the best overall accuracy of 97% and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. Space-borne SAR and optical data add a new aspect of crop type mapping, which increases the classification accuracy by including valuable parameters and beating the drawbacks of each other. By comparing the results, it can be concluded that combining all-weather accessible SAR and spectrally rich optical data accomplished more accurate outcomes. It would be an imperative advance for the future endeavor to estimate crop biomass and biophysical parameters.

AB  - The spatial distribution of crops is an important agricultural parameter, which is used to derive important information about crop productivity and food security. However, crop mapping on a large scale is challenging due to the low spatio-temporal information of satellite data, sparse sampling, and poor computational efficiency for massive data. To alleviate these problems, this study proposes a method based on discrete grids with machine learning to integrate GaoFen-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. First, the proposed method fuses multi-source satellite data with similar observation characteristics to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of satellites. Second, a data augmentation technique based on a discrete grid framework was proposed to solve the problem of sparse samples. Finally, a machine learning algorithm in a discrete grid was introduced to improve processing efficiency and ensure the crop classification precision of large-scale remote sensing images. An experiment in the Sanjiang Plain area (approximately 108900 km2) of Northeast China showed that the proposed scheme benefited from a high spatio-temporal multi-source dataset and achieved good performance. Compared with a single data source, the accuracy of crop mapping using multi-source optical remote sensing data is higher, attaining up to 86 and 88 % in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Furthermore, the advantages of machine learning in discrete grids over large-scale areas are validated by evaluating the accuracy of different classifiers, which indicates the suitability of discrete grids in data augmentation and large-scale crop mapping. Finally, discrete grid technology offers a possibility for crop mapping over large-scale areas, and improves the processing efficiency of remote sensing big data. The findings in this study can contribute to studies on large-scale crop classification and serve as a reference to them.

AB  - Accurate crop yield prediction for more precise forecasting of price volatility in crop markets, better agricultural planning and enhanced national food security is one of the important utilities of crop monitoring systems. Due to the spatiotemporal nonlinear characteristic of crop yields, recent studies have actively used various machine learning approaches to predict crop yields. However, there are few studies that have compared these approaches, and even in those cases, the comparison was restricted to one or two crops or a specific region. In this study, we evaluated seven popular machine learning approaches, for the same input variables, over three crops: paddy rice in South Korea and corn and soybean in Illinois and Iowa, USA. Based on the data from April to September, six time-series scenarios of different range of months for each crop were tested for prediction accuracy with 14-year (2003-2016). The time-series data include vegetation indices from Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), weather data, crop yield statistics, and a land cover map of county-level spatial resolution and 16-day-aggregated temporal resolution. In the results, regardless of crop type, support vector machine (SVM) presented the most accurate result with the lowest average root mean square error (RRMSE), in comparison with a decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), stacked-sparse autoencoder (SSAE), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Also, we derived best cases for each crop yield prediction out of six time-series scenarios, which were May – September data for rice and corn and June – August data for soybean for the test sites. Considering all of the findings together, SVM is an appropriate method for crop yield prediction based on MODIS-based vegetation indices and weather data of county-level spatial resolution and approximately one-half-month temporal resolution.

This study proposed two optimization methods, i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), to determine the input weights and hidden biases of extreme learning machine (ELM), and developed two novel hybrid GA-ELM and PSO-ELM models for ETo estimations with limited input data. A temporal and spatial scanning strategy that can avoid misleading or partially valid results was applied to train and test the models, using daily climatic data during 1994–2016 from 96 meteorological stations across various climates of China. The results revealed that GA-ELM and PSO-ELM could quantify ETo on daily, monthly, and annual time scales, with GA-ELM (with model efficiency ranging from 0.80 to 0.97) performing better than PSO-ELM (with model efficiency ranging from 0.70 to 0.93) in all climates. The temperature-based GA-ELM only with air temperature data as forcing input has relatively accurate ETo estimates across different environments, and can be recommended as an alternative method when radiation data are not available. Spatial assessment reveals that the machine learning models trained by external data also offer accurate ETo estimates, confirming the applicability of models for ETo estimations elsewhere without the model training or when local data for model training are unavailable. Overall, the GA-ELM model provides accurate ETo estimates on various time scales and exhibits superior performance than the PSO-ELM model, and thus can be recommended for ETo estimations using limited data as model forcing in different climates of China. Our work presents a novel method for accurate ETo estimations with limited data, which has practical implications in regional agricultural water management.

AB  - The European legislative guidelines on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) lead to an obligation of area-wide information about cross-compliant Greening measures in EU countries. But by on-site controlling, agricultural authorities can monitor only a small portion of all registered parcels. With the Copernicus Programme, the freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery increasingly supports remote sensing-based agricultural monitoring on a large-scale. However, most prototypes lack the topic of winter catch cropping. Therefore, we developed a new machine learning method for catch crop monitoring and detection at the parcel-level. To gain training and test data for supervised machine learning, we collected winter catch crop parcel data from different years (2016–2019) and four federal states in Germany. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series were calculated for each parcel from Sentinel-2 data within the typical winter catch crop cultivation season (July-April). We revealed distinctive temporal patterns of catch cropping and developed nineteen descriptive features for automatized prediction. Then, we trained fifteen Random Forest classifiers comprising different regions and years and conducted a multi-level validation to identify the model with the highest robustness on new data. The Random Forest classifier trained with the input data from all federal states and years outperformed the other models. It reached a mean prediction accuracy of 84% for both classes (catch crop and non-catch crop) across eleven different spatio-temporal domains. Under optimal annual weather conditions it reached accuracies close to 90%. Anomalies caused by heat waves and early frost events were found to have a high influence on the phenology of catch crops and thus lead to reduced prediction accuracies. From the set of predictors, those features with the highest importance measured the correlation between the observed time series and a simulated NDVI phenological profile. We concluded that catch cropping parcels are automatically separable from parcels with other winter cultivations (e.g., winter cereals, grasslands, fallow) with Sentinel-2 NDVI time series data. Different catch crop subgroups (i.e., seed mixes) could not be differentiated by our approach due to very similar phenological profiles. Nonetheless, the used approach allows for large-scale winter catch crop monitoring and supports authorities in the selection of parcels with high demand for on-site controlling. By merging the training datasets from different federal states and years, we could overcome the typical spatial and temporal overfitting problem in machine learning. Therefore, the study’s final classifier can be reliably transferred to new datasets in Germany and other regions with similar bio-geographical conditions.

AB  - CONTEXT
Accurate estimation of yield losses from natural disasters on a regional scale can guide agronomic management and agricultural insurance, transfer disaster risk, and ensure food security. Conventional yield losses, however, mainly depend on historical events, for which detailed records of locations and losses are unavailable.
OBJECTIVE
The development of a disaster vulnerability model has consequently been hindered by the lack of sufficient samples. To improve regional yield estimates, a novel method for estimating yield losses and the pure insurance rate is thus strongly needed.
METHODS
Using 129 major wheat-producing counties on the North China Plain as an example, we developed a drought assessment system based on crop growth modeling, machine learning, and satellite data. The initial model used was the model to simulate the crop–weather relationship over a large area (MCWLA) applied to wheat (MCWLA-Wheat), which was then calibrated by multi-step-assimilation with multi-source data. We first established various drought scenarios to simulate the impacts of drought at different growth stages on wheat yield by driving the calibrated MCWLA-Wheat.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
According to our results, drought-sensitive stages of wheat varied by drought severity, with insufficient water supply during the Greenup–Heading stage having the most significant impact on grain yields. Based on the outputs of the simulation and three drought indicators—standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil moisture index (SSMI), and relative leaf area index (RLAI), we then established vulnerability models coupling the MCWLA-Wheat with statistical models (random forest [RF] and multiple linear regression [MLR]). The vulnerability model MCWLA+RF showed higher accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6% (i.e., 365 kg ha−1), relative to that of the MCWLA+MLR (RMSE = 1175 kg ha−1). Ranked in descending order, the relative importance of drought indicators at Greenup–Heading was SPI, SMMI-20 cm, and RLAI.
SIGNIFICANCE
Our study has highlighted a potential method for quantifying crop disaster risk—integration of a scenario-driven crop growth model, machine learning, and satellite data—that can be applied to other crops and regions.

AB  - Food production in any country depends primarily on the type of soil and the weather condition. Out of the different crop production types in this research, three major crops have been considered, such as rice, wheat, and sugarcane. The crop growth generally depends on the macronutrients and micronutrient content of the soil, which is again a parametric representation of different climatic conditions such as rain, humidity, temperature, sunlight, and pH content of the soil. This research focused on establishing and interrelating the micronutrients and the weather parameters and classifying the type of crop based on the micronutrients using a support vector machine and decision tree algorithm. Different types of tools, such as curve fitting and data analysis using Python-3.9.0, have been used for prediction purposes.

AB  - With an upcoming unprecedented stream of imaging spectroscopy data, there is a rising need for tools and software applications exploiting the spectral possibilities to extract relevant information on an operational basis. In this study, we investigate the potential of a scientific processor designed to quantify biophysical and biochemical crop traits from spectroscopic imagery of the upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite. Said processor relies on a hybrid retrieval workflow executing pre-trained machine learning regression models fast and efficiently based on training data from a lookup table of synthetic vegetation spectra and their associated parameterization of the well-known radiative transfer model (RTM) PROSAIL. The established models provide spatial information about leaf area index (LAI), average leaf inclination angle (ALIA), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and leaf mass per area (Cm). In contrast to using site-specific training data, the approach facilitates a universal application without the need to integrate a priori information into the processor. Four machine learning algorithms, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were found to estimate biophysical and biochemical variables of unseen targets with high performance (relative error scores < 10%). ANNs excelled in terms of accuracy, model size and execution time when the 242 spectral bands were transformed into 15 principal components, the signals of which were scaled by a z-transformation. Validation using in situ data from the SPARC03 Barrax campaign dataset revealed an overall good estimation of measured functional traits, for instance for LAI with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.81 m2 m−2, and for Cab RMSE of 6.2 µg cm−2 with the ANN model. Moreover, both crop traits could be successfully mapped using a pseudo-EnMAP scene revealing plausible within-field patterns. Conformity with LAI output of the SNAP biophysical processor was found especially for grassland and maize in the vegetative stages. Based on these findings, ANN models are considered the best choice for implementation of a hybrid retrieval workflow within the context of operational agricultural crop traits monitoring from future satellite imaging spectroscopy.

AB  - Agriculture plays a crucial role in Indian economy. Crop yield is main component of food security as human population is increasing in a drastic way. One of the most important problems of agriculture is crop yield prediction. Agriculture yield depends on the various factors such as weather situation (rain, humidity, temperature etc.), information about pesticides. Apart from these factors exact information about the crop yield history is an essential concept for making predictions and controlling agriculture risk. Earlier yield prediction was performed by considering the farmer's experience on a particular field and crop. In this study machine learning is used to predict four popular yields which are mostly cultivated all over India. Once the crop yield is site specifically predicted, the inputs such as fertilizers could be applied variably according to the expected crop and soil needs. In our study we use Machine Learning approaches to develop a trained model to identify the patterns among data and it is used for crop prediction. In this study the prediction of four most cultivated yields in India is considered by applying machine learning. These crops include: Maize, Potatoes, Rice (Paddy) and wheat.

KW  - Large-scale crop yield forecasting
AB  - Many studies have applied machine learning to crop yield prediction with a focus on specific case studies. The data and methods they used may not be transferable to other crops and locations. On the other hand, operational large-scale systems, such as the European Commission's MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), do not use machine learning. Machine learning is a promising method especially when large amounts of data are being collected and published. We combined agronomic principles of crop modeling with machine learning to build a machine learning baseline for large-scale crop yield forecasting. The baseline is a workflow emphasizing correctness, modularity and reusability. For correctness, we focused on designing explainable predictors or features (in relation to crop growth and development) and applying machine learning without information leakage. We created features using crop simulation outputs and weather, remote sensing and soil data from the MCYFS database. We emphasized a modular and reusable workflow to support different crops and countries with small configuration changes. The workflow can be used to run repeatable experiments (e.g. early season or end of season predictions) using standard input data to obtain reproducible results. The results serve as a starting point for further optimizations. In our case studies, we predicted yield at regional level for five crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, sugar beet, potatoes) and three countries (the Netherlands (NL), Germany (DE), France (FR)). We compared the performance with a simple method with no prediction skill, which either predicted a linear yield trend or the average of the training set. We also aggregated the predictions to the national level and compared with past MCYFS forecasts. The normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for early season predictions (30 days after planting) were comparable for NL (all crops), DE (all except soft wheat) and FR (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower). For example, NRMSE was 7.87 for soft wheat (NL) (6.32 for MCYFS) and 8.21 for sugar beet (DE) (8.79 for MCYFS). In contrast, NRMSEs for soft wheat (DE), sugar beet (FR) and potatoes (FR) were twice as much compared to MCYFS. NRMSEs for end of season were still comparable to MCYFS for NL, but worse for DE and FR. The baseline can be improved by adding new data sources, designing more predictive features and evaluating different machine learning algorithms. The baseline will motivate the use of machine learning in large-scale crop yield forecasting.

AB  - Agricultural decision-making is crucial for future yields. In the context of smart farming, grower combine information from sensors located close to their crops with agronomic models to help them to better understand their crops. Irrigation management is therefore based on extrapolation of data and/or agronomic model responses. This problem can be seen as a learning task for which machine learning techniques have proven their relevance in many and diverse applications. In this paper we place ourselves in the context of potato farming, a crop for which irrigation plays a crucial role. We model the problem of soil water potential prediction as a learning problem solved by supervised leaning algorithms. The problem appears to be difficult since there are several potential inputs, and several outputs to predict. Experiments are conducted on several scenarios with data acquired during 3 years. We demonstrate the possibility of applying feature selection method to automatically design models with features relevant to the problem at hand while having good performances. We have also demonstrated the relevance of the machine learning for this kind of problem, since the methods are able to correctly predict the next water potential values.

AB  - The agriculture sector has an immense potential to improve the requirement of food and supplies healthy and nutritious food. Crop insect detection is a challenging task for farmers as a significant portion of the crops are damaged, and the quality is degraded due to the pest attack. Traditional insect identification has the drawback of requiring well-trained taxonomists to identify insects based on morphological features accurately. Experiments were conducted for classification on nine and 24 insect classes of Wang and Xie dataset using the shape features and applying machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive bayes (NB) and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This paper presents the insect pest detection algorithm that consists of foreground extraction and contour identification to detect the insects for Wang, Xie, Deng, and IP102 datasets in a highly complex background. The 9-fold cross-validation was applied to improve the performance of the classification models. The highest classification rate of 91.5% and 90% was achieved for nine and 24 class insects using the CNN model. The detection performance was accomplished with less computation time for Wang, Xie, Deng, and IP102 datasets using insect pest detection algorithm. The comparison results with the state-of-the-art classification algorithms exhibited considerable improvement in classification accuracy, computation time performance while apply more efficiently in field crops to recognize the insects. The results of classification accuracy are used to recognize the crop insects in the early stages and reduce the time to enhance the crop yield and crop quality in agriculture.

AB  - Bistatic specular (Bi-spec) scatterometer measurement system was indigenously designed at X- and C-bands in the incidence angular range from 20° to 60° at the interval of 10° to study the scattering mechanism of vegetation growth parameters of paddy crop and their retrieval at HH and VV polarizations using machine learning algorithms. The contributions of coherent and incoherent scattering to the total reflected or scattered power was measured by the bi-spec scatterometer system to derive bi-spec scattering coefficient(σ0). The effect of vegetation growth parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), plant height (PH), vegetation water content (VWC) and fresh biomass (FBm) on the σ0was investigated. The values of σHH0 at C-band were observed to be higher at HH-polarization as compared to σHH0at X-band for all specular incidence angles due to higher penetrating ability than the X-band. An approach was made to find out the optimum parameters of the bi-spec scatterometer system by correlation analysis between the computed σ0and vegetation growth parameters of paddy crop and their retrieval by the SVR model using linear, polynomial and radial kernels. The optimum parameters of the bi-spec scatterometer system for the retrieval of LAI, FBm and VWC of paddy crop were found to be HH polarization, 40° angle of incidence at C-band. While, for PH retrieval, the optimum parameters were found to be VV polarization, 40° angle of incidence at X band. The potential of the developed SVR model was evaluated by computing centered root mean square error (CRMSE), standard deviation (SD) and correlation coefficient (R) between estimated and observed vegetation growth parameters. The retrieval of the vegetation growth parameters of paddy crop by the developed SVR model using radial kernel provided better results in comparison to linear and polynomial kernels for LAI, FBm and VWC at C-band and PH at X-band using bi-spec scatterometer data.

AB  - Accurate and up-to-date spatial agricultural information is essential for applications including agro-environmental assessment, crop management, and appropriate targeting of agricultural technologies. There is growing research interest in spatial analysis of agricultural ecosystems applying satellite remote sensing technologies. However, usability of information generated from many of remotely sensed data is often constrained by accuracy problems. This is of particular concern in mapping complex agro-ecosystems in countries where small farm holdings are dominated by diverse crop types. This study is a contribution to the ongoing efforts towards overcoming accuracy challenges faced in remote sensing of agricultural ecosystems. We applied time-series analysis of vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor to detect seasonal patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropping patterns in five townships in the Central Dry Zone of Myanmar, which is an important agricultural region of the country has been poorly mapped with respect to cropping practices. To improve mapping accuracy and map legend completeness, we implemented a combination of (i) an iterative participatory approach to field data collection and classification, (ii) the identification of appropriate size and types of predictor variables (VIs), and (iii) evaluation of the suitability of three Machine Learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and C5.0 algorithms under varying training sample sizes. Through these procedures, we were able to progressively improve accuracy and achieve maximum overall accuracy of 95% When a small sized training dataset was used, accuracy achieved by RF was significantly higher compared to SVM and C5.0 (P < 0.01), but as sample size increased, accuracy differences among the three machine learning algorithms diminished. Accuracy achieved by use of NDVI was consistently better than that of EVI (P < 0.01). The maximum overall accuracy was achieved using RF and 8-days NDVI composites for three years of remote sensing data. In conclusion, our findings highlight the important role of participatory classification, especially in areas where cropping systems are highly diverse and differ over space and time. We also show that the choice of classifiers and size of predictor variables are essential and complementary to the participatory mapping approach in achieving desired accuracy of cropping pattern mapping in areas where other sources of spatial information are scarce.

AB  - An important factor in a circular agricultural system is the efficient use of animal manure. Until now, the applied quantity of manure is regulated by law at farm level, based on fixed phosphorus (P) application norms. However, a first step towards more efficient manure application is to better balance P input and output at field level by predicting future P yields. Machine learning techniques can be useful in this respect, because they can be trained with many variables without prior knowledge regarding their interrelationship. This study’s objective, therefore, was to predict P yields based on detailed records of on-farm data as recorded on an experimental farm combined with open source weather data. The dataset contained 657 records of annual crop yields per field between 1993 and 2016, and the boosted regression model was used for model development. Validation on the final five years of the dataset resulted in an RMSE of 7.3 kg P per ha per year, an R-squared of 0.46 and a correlation between observed and predicted values of 0.68, outperforming legal norms. We conclude that with the limited but detailed data available, prediction of P yield, and therewith, defining flexible P application norms before first manure application, is already feasible. This conclusion, together with the expected increasing availability of data through proximal and remote sensing technologies, opens the way to further improve nutrient management and move towards circular agriculture in the future.

AB  - Hyperspectral acquisitions have proven to be the most informative Earth observation data source for the estimation of nitrogen (N) content, which is the main limiting nutrient for plant growth and thus agricultural production. In the past, empirical algorithms have been widely employed to retrieve information on this biochemical plant component from canopy reflectance. However, these approaches do not seek for a cause-effect relationship based on physical laws. Moreover, most studies solely relied on the correlation of chlorophyll content with nitrogen, and thus neglected the fact that most N is bound in proteins. Our study presents a hybrid retrieval method using a physically-based approach combined with machine learning regression to estimate crop N content. Within the workflow, the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT-PRO including the newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients (SAC) of proteins, was coupled with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL to PROSAIL-PRO. The latter was then employed to generate a training database to be used for advanced probabilistic machine learning methods: a standard homoscedastic Gaussian process (GP) and a heteroscedastic GP regression that accounts for signal-to-noise relations. Both GP models have the property of providing confidence intervals for the estimates, which sets them apart from other machine learners. Moreover, a GP-based sequential backward band removal algorithm was employed to analyze the band-specific information content of PROSAIL-PRO simulated spectra for the estimation of aboveground N. Data from multiple hyperspectral field campaigns, carried out in the framework of the future satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), were exploited for validation. In these campaigns, corn and winter wheat spectra were acquired to simulate spectral EnMAP data. Moreover, destructive N measurements from leaves, stalks and fruits were collected separately to enable plant-organ-specific validation. The results showed that both GP models can provide accurate aboveground N simulations, with slightly better results of the heteroscedastic GP in terms of model testing and against in situ N measurements from leaves plus stalks, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.1 g/m². However, the inclusion of fruit N content for validation deteriorated the results, which can be explained by the inability of the radiation to penetrate the thick tissues of stalks, corn cobs and wheat ears. GP-based band analysis identified optimal spectral settings with ten bands mainly situated in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. Use of well-known protein absorption bands from the literature showed comparative results. Finally, the heteroscedastic GP model was successfully applied on airborne hyperspectral data for N mapping. We conclude that GP algorithms, and in particular the heteroscedastic GP, should be implemented for global agricultural monitoring of aboveground N from future imaging spectroscopy data.

AB  - The prediction and identification of the factors controlling heavy metal transfer in soil-crop ecosystems are of critical importance. In this study, random forest (RF), gradient boosted machine (GBM), and generalised linear (GLM) models were compared after being used to model and identify prior factors that affect the transfer of heavy metals (HMs) in soil-crop systems in the Yangtze River Delta, China, based on 13 covariates with 1822 pairs of soil-crop samples. The mean bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for all crops followed the order Cd > Zn > As > Cu > Ni > Hg > Cr > Pb. The RF model showed the best prediction ability for the BAFs of HMs in soil-crop ecosystems, followed by GBM and GLM. The R2 values of the RF models for the BAFs of Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Hg, Cd, As, and Pb were 0.84, 0.66, 0.59, 0.58, 0.58, 0.51, 0.30, and 0.17, respectively. The primary controlling factor in soil-to-crop transfer of all HMs under study was plant type, followed by soil heavy metal content and soil organic materials. The model used herein could be used to assist the prediction of heavy metal contents in crops based on heavy metal contents in soil and other covariates, and can significantly reduce the cost, labour, and time requirements involved with laboratory analysis. It can also be used to quantify the importance of variables and identify potential control factors in heavy metal bioaccumulation in soil-crop ecosystems.

AB  - The fractional vegetation cover (FVC), crop residue cover (CRC), and bare soil (BS) are three important parameters in vegetation–soil ecosystems, and their correct and timely estimation can improve crop monitoring and environmental monitoring. The triangular space method uses one CRC index and one vegetation index to create a triangular space in which the three vertices represent pure vegetation, crop residue, and bare soil. Subsequently, the CRC, FVC, and BS of mixed remote sensing pixels can be distinguished by their spatial locations in the triangular space. However, soil moisture and crop-residue moisture (SM-CRM) significantly reduce the performance of broadband remote sensing CRC indices and can thus decrease the accuracy of the remote estimation and mapping of CRC, FVC, and BS. This study evaluated the use of broadband remote sensing, the triangular space method, and the random forest (RF) technique to estimate and map the FVC, CRC, and BS of cropland in which SM-CRM changes dramatically. A spectral dataset was obtained using: (1) from a field-based experiment with a field spectrometer; and (2) from a laboratory-based simulation that included four distinct soil types, three types of crop residue (winter-wheat, maize, and rice), one crop (winter wheat), and varying SM-CRM. We trained an RF model [designated the broadband crop-residue index from random forest (CRRF)] that can magnify spectral features of crop residue and soil by using the broadband remote sensing angle indices as input, and uses a moisture-resistant hyperspectral index as the target. The effects of moisture on crop residue and soil were minimized by using the broadband CRRF. Then, the CRRF-NDVI triangular space method was used to estimate and map CRC, FVC, and BS. Our method was validated by using both laboratory- and field-based experiments and Sentinel-2 broadband remote-sensing images. Our results indicate that the CRRF-NDVI triangular space method can reduce the effect of moisture on the broadband remote-sensing of CRC, and may also help to obtain laboratory and field CRC, FVC, and BS. Thus, the proposed method has great potential for application to croplands in which the SM-CRM content changes dramatically.

KW  - Pre-harvest crop type classification
KW  - Image selection
KW  - Operational crop type mapping
KW  - Machine learning classifiers
AB  - Timely crop type information (preferably before harvest) is useful for predicting food surpluses or shortages. This study assesses the performance of several machine learning classifiers, namely SVM (support vector machine), DT (decision tree), k-NN (k-nearest neighbour), RF (random forest) and ML (maximum likelihood) for crop type mapping based on a series of Sentinel-2 images. Four experiments with different combinations of image sets were carried out. The first three experiments were undertaken with 1) single-date (uni-temporal) images; 2) combinations of five images selected from the best performing single-date images; and 3) five images selected manually based on crop development stages. The fourth experiment involved the chronologic addition of images to assess the performance of the classifiers when only pre-harvest images are used, with the purpose of investigating how early in the season reasonable accuracies can be achieved. The experiments were carried out in two different sites in the Western Cape Province of South Africa to provide a good representation of the grain-producing areas in the region which has a Mediterranean climate. The significance of image selection on classification accuracies as well as the performance of machine learning classifiers when only pre-harvest images are used were evaluated. The classification results were analysed by comparing overall accuracies and kappa coefficients, while McNemar′s test and ANOVA (analysis of variance) were used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in accuracies among experiments. The results show that by selecting images based on individual performance, a viable alternative to selecting images based on crop developmental stages is offered, and that the classification of crops with an entire time series can be just as accurate as when they are classified with a subset of hand-selected images. We also found that good classification accuracies (77.2%) can be obtained with the use of SVM and RF as early as eight weeks before harvest. This result shows that pre-harvest images have the potential to identify crops accurately, which holds much potential for operational within-season crop type mapping.

AB  - Soybean yield predictions in Brazil are of great interest for market behavior, to drive governmental policies and to increase global food security. In Brazil soybean yield data generally demand various revisions through the following months after harvest suggesting that there is space for improving the accuracy and the time of yield predictions. This study presents a novel model to perform in-season (“near real-time”) soybean yield forecasts in southern Brazil using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Neural Networks, satellite imagery and weather data. The objectives of this study were to: (i) compare the performance of three different algorithms (multivariate OLS linear regression, random forest and LSTM neural networks) for forecasting soybean yield using NDVI, EVI, land surface temperature and precipitation as independent variables, and (ii) evaluate how early (during the soybean growing season) this method is able to forecast yield with reasonable accuracy. Satellite and weather data were masked using a non-crop-specific layer with field boundaries obtained from the Rural Environment Registry that is mandatory for all farmers in Brazil. Main outcomes from this study were: (i) soybean yield forecasts at municipality-scale with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24 Mg ha−1 at DOY 64 (march 5) (ii) a superior performance of the LSTM neural networks relative to the other algorithms for all the forecast dates except DOY 16 where multivariate OLS linear regression provided the best performance, and (iii) model performance (e.g., MAE) for yield forecast decreased when predictions were performed earlier in the season, with MAE increasing from 0.24 Mg ha−1 to 0.42 Mg ha−1 (last values from OLS regression) when forecast timing changed from DOY 64 (March 5) to DOY 16 (January 6). This research portrays the benefits of integrating statistical techniques, remote sensing, weather to field survey data in order to perform more reliable in-season soybean yield forecasts.

AB  - Rice is the most important staple food crop in India. However, it is one of the crops which tends to be affected frequently by disease causing agents resulting in reduced yield. Although several challenges affect the growth of the crops, such as pest, environmental conditions and natural diseases, crop diseases is one of the major threats to food security. The diseases are caused by bacteria or fungi that can affect the crop at any stage. In the proposed system, the preprocessed images of both infected and healthy rice crops are given as input to the machine learning algorithms via., Convolutional Neural Network (CCN) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The results show that CNN combined with SVM based classification method provides better accuracy than that of SVM applied alone for both infected and normal images of paddy blast disease. The proposed method would immensely benefit the farmers in terms of increased revenue and ensures food security to the nation at large.

AB  - Current injury surveillance efforts in agriculture are considerably hampered by the limited quantity of occupation or industry data in current health records. This has impeded efforts to develop more accurate injury burden estimates and has negatively impacted the prioritization of workplace health and safety in state and federal public health efforts. This paper describes the development of a Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm to identify occupational injuries in agriculture using existing administrative data, specifically in pre-hospital care reports (PCR).
